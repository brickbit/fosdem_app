For this reason, we firmly believe that it is essential to promote sovereignty, transparency, and openness in this strategic field. Having built the OpenLLM-France open source community (https://www.openllm-france.com/) with more 360 individual/company members, LINAGORA is now looking to expand this vision to the whole of Europe, taking into account the numerous languages that it represents. This talk will present associated challenges and show how we plan to address them. It will also include a call to all stakeholders at the Europe level interested in testing, experimenting with, and implementing open source LLMs to join us in this community.",

          "description": "LINAGORA, as a leader in the Open LLM France community, has made it a priority to pull the curtain off of the process of building Large Language Models (LLMs). While most LLMs in use today – even the “open” ones – reveal few to no details about their training, and especially the data on which they are trained, we have decided to share it all. In this talk, we discuss why using an open model trained on traceable data is important for business and research alike and examine some of the difficulties involved in pursuing an open strategy for LLMs. We bring to the table our experience with data collection and training of LLMs, including the Claire family of language models.

          "description": "Knowing the \"cost\" of a specific piece of code, either in terms of runtime or in terms size, is quite important in guiding optimization efforts. However, understanding the actual cost of a piece of code, especially its runtime cost, is quite nontrivial. Benchmarks can be hard to run reliably, might require specialized hardware or software environments, and can be quite noisy. While the machines that the code we wish to analyze runs on are fundamentally deterministic, the lack of availability of low-level details from CPU/GPU manufacturers inhibits low-level performance analysis work. To this end, we present two pieces of work towards achieving production-ready ML-based cost modes. Firstly, GNNs to analyze the performance of small snippets of assembly, and secondly small LLMs to predict the final size of a functions as a stepping stone towards performance prediction. In addition, we outline other work in the area, such as dataset construction, to enable further experimentation on these problems within the community.",

          "description": "In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we're witnessing a significant shift in deep-learning design patterns, particularly with the advancement of foundational models. A key innovation in this area is the concept of 'adapters' – small yet powerful add-ons that enhance an existing neural network with new capabilities without retraining its core layers. However, this innovation brings a hefty software engineering challenge, mainly when we discuss creating an open-source library encompassing a diverse range of these adapters. Neural networks, by their nature, are built using frameworks that procedurally encode their operations. Every time a new adapter is introduced, it often requires a substantial rewrite or rethinking of the existing code base. To address this challenge, we've developed 'Refiners' – a streamlined micro-framework built on top of PyTorch, one of the most popular machine learning frameworks. The goal of Refiners is to serve as a comprehensive collection of foundational models and their respective adapters. Its primary design pattern sets it apart: envisioning all neural networks as a 'Chain' of primary layers, neatly nested one after the other. Furthermore, we've integrated the 'Context API,' a feature that allows the implementation of complex models, including those that don't follow a simple linear structure. By doing so, Refiners simplifies the integration of new adapters, making it easier for developers to build and enhance neural networks without the need to overhaul their entire code base each time. This approach saves time and opens up new possibilities for innovation in AI development.",

          "description": "More and more applications are being developed which consume Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is used in applications as diverse as fraud detection, medical detection, sales, security, and many more. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017 and companies are now promoting an AI first strategy with their products and services. But if a developer wants to consume AI in their applications, do they need to be an AI expert? The simple answer is No! In this talk application developers will learn how they can treat AI the same as any other \"function\" where they give it input and it returns the expected output. This is made possible by open source AI frameworks that enable users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. Discussion will revolve around open source frameworks like Ray, TGIS, Triton and TorchServe, to give an understanding of the tools available to help on the AI journey. There will be a demo of one of these runtimes in action by loading open source models from Hugging Face from different domains and querying the models through a web UI. There are great open source tools out there that provide an abstraction layer for application developers where they can consume AI models through APIs independent of understanding the data form of the model. Walking away from this talk, programmers will have a good appreciation of how they can practically consume AI in their applications without being an AI master.",

          "description": "AI models, particularly LLMs, readily and sometimes unwittingly may plagiarize content—what constitutes acceptable use is currently not fully resolved— opening their users to copyright tort and other forms of litigation. For society an immanent danger is also in how easily they can be poisoned or lobotomized to propagate disinformation. It is also difficult to uncover and address sources of bias. The later is of particular legislative concern—see emerging regulations such as the EU’s AI Act as a prototype for whats to come. Without traceability for data with clear license expressions and provenance, AI models are easy targets. The open source community are particularly vulnerable and defenseless. Without a preemptive strategy legal risks are untenable. We expect an avalanche of litigation in response to AI driven disruption of the business of established information providers and creatives. The talk focuses on both the legal and moral issues at hand but also the means to address the issues through traceability and model governance.",

Machine learning functionality seamlessly woven into products and platforms makes our lives a little bit easier. A wealth of APIs, libraries, and tools make it trivial to tap into sophisticated models and methodologies that give our applications an intelligent edge. When thinking (or \"thinking\") about open source and artificial intelligence, we see some significant challenges in retaining the open source ethos that has made open source software such a force for technological advancement. Join us in a Principled Component Analysis of artificial intelligence as we explore some key issues facing us in this new frontier of open source.",

          "description": "Ethical AI has emerged as a pivotal global discourse, reflecting the growing realization of its profound impact on societies worldwide. While social issues give rise to policy solutions and thus legislations, ethics are deeply rooted in societal values that differ greatly from one jurisdiction to another. In the last decade, diverse groups and individuals have departed from using exclusively Free Software licenses on their projects to developing new types of licensing solutions which prioritize “ethical” restrictions on how software should be further used and distributed. In this talk, I will delve into the ethical dimensions of the convergence of AI and Free Software, examining the challenges and opportunities in building responsible and ethical AI solutions within the free software ecosystem. This talk firstly provides examples of some of the most common licensing models imposing “ethical” restrictions. It then examines how licensing models imposing additional behavior restrictions that supposedly call themselves “open” are in contravention of the definitions of Free Software and Open Source Software. We will further explore some predominant material harms emanating from the use of these restrictive licenses. Lastly, given the various technical & legal obstacles in using these restrictive licenses, I implore that the ethical compliance checks must fall within the purview of regulations and not software licenses. Given the proliferation of ethical licenses in AI landscapes causing additional behavior restrictions, integration of Free Software, license compatibility and licensing compliance become more complex, affecting the whole ecosystem. This presentation seeks to increase awareness about this crucial issue, particularly as public funds are being allocated to AI projects that may, at times, employ restrictive licensing practices.",

The Open Source Initiative is inviting developers of AI and users to find the principles of Open Source applied to AI systems. Finding an agreement on what constitutes Open Source AI is the most important challenge facing the free software (also known as open source) movement. European regulation already started referring to \"free and open source AI\", large economic actors like Meta are calling their systems \"open source\" despite the fact that their license contain restrictions on fields-of-use (among other things) and the landscape is evolving so quickly that if we don't keep up, we'll be irrelevant. The session will have a short introduction to the project, which started mid-2023, followed by a summary of the most current draft of the Definition. The bulk of the session will be an assignment for the audience: to review the draft Definition and provide comments. The responses will be used as feedback to release a new draft.",

          "description": "In this talk we discuss work by TechWorks, the trade body for electronic systems engineering in the UK, to create a collaborative, open guide to help electronic systems engineers expand their skillset to AI roles. TechWorks is not specifically an open source organization. However for a number of years it has taken an open approach to many of its standardization practices. For example all the guides from the IoT Security Foundation (part of TechWorks) are release under a Creative Commons license. We will give a brief overview of this organization at the start of the talk. TechWorks identified that the shortage of AI engineers would represent a problem for the industry going forward. However this is an industry with many, experienced software and hardware engineers. The need therefore was for material to help those engineers transition to AI. The result, now 18 months into its development, is an open guide to best practice in AI and Machine Learning for experienced professional engineers (https://technes-uk.github.io/best-practice-guide/). The source is maintained on GitHub and written in Sphinx, using a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://github.com/TechNES-UK/best-practice-guide). This allows easy community contributions using pull-requests. We'll explore the challenges in developing this guide, and share plans for completing the initial release, and then maintaining it going forward.",

This talk introduces you to the OpenAPI standard, showing how to describe APIs and looking at some popular API examples. Good tools are essential so we'll look at some of the open source tools available to working with OpenAPI easier. We'll cover the benefits of using an open standard to describe your APIs and discuss what you can do next, like publishing documentation, generating code, and teaching LLMs new tricks. Learn about what's coming up in the world of OpenAPI, and how to get involved with this open standard and its community.",

          "description": "For developers building distributed applications, few things are more frustrating than having an API break unexpectedly. When an API changes in a backwards-incompatible way, it can disrupt downstream consumers. Suddenly, applications start failing, integrations break, and developers are left scrambling to fix the issues. How can developers deploy changes fast without breaking APIs and maintain stability for consumers? By adding modern observability techniques to their APIOps pipeline. In this talk, we will start together from a traditional APIOps pipeline in ArgoCD and explore how incorporating modern observability techniques can help developers deploy changes quickly and efficiently while maintaining stability for API consumers. In this presentation, Sonja (Group Product Manager in the API space) and Adnan (5 years in the observability space) are combining their expertise to present best practices for detecting and resolving API issues in production. This talk will be helpful for developers working with APIs, helping them extend their GitOps practices by using distributed tracing in pre-production to identify and fix issues before they reach production. But it will also be helpful for any users of OpenTelemetry, Jaeger and/or ArgoCD.",

However, chances are you’ll be successful, and you’ll “hit the wall”. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I’ll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who’s using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I’ll use the Apache APISIX project for it.",

          "description": "Calendars are a building block of our work tools. Unfortunately, managing calendars is often a nightmare. The reason for this is simple: the big companies hosting most of the calendar services are not trying very hard to provide interroperability between their services, or facilitate the use of calendars not hosted by themselves. One particular setting that is very painful when using calendars is the case of public-calendars. While a lot of organizations have a public-calendar available to stay informed about the events they organize, it is actually very complicated to leverage these calendars in a natural way: First of all, not all caldav clients support public-calendars, or at least not as well as “account” calendars. Often, they allow to “bulk import” multiples ical events inside your calendar client but not suscribe to the underlying calendar. This means that new events will not be added to your calendar automatically; Public-calendars are not easily composable: it is not possible to merge multiple public-calendars together in order for example to share a collection of calendars; It is not possible to filter events in public-calendars. We may be interested only in a subset of events in a calendar (events occuring on mondays for example, or taking place in Paris, or any other criterion). Linkal is a software developped to solve the above problems. It is a public-calendar aggregator server. It acts as a man-in-the-middle between a caldav client and some public-calendars. Given a list of public-calendar, it emulates a calendar collection containing all these calendars. The user can then use its usual caldav client and add the collection as an “account” calendar (specifying the url of the Linkal instance instead of the caldav server). This allows the collection to be shared easily to multiple users and seamlessly updated. The talk will present the challenges to collaborations using calendars and the solutions that Linkal provides.",

          "description": "OpenTalk is more than just another video conferencing solution. Designed with a special focus on data protection and security, OpenTalk offers a completely reimagined solution ideally suited for public administration. With its modern IT architecture and strict data segregation, OpenTalk meets the highest standards of data protection and security, fully compliant with the GDPR. In the public sector, data protection is not just a buzzword; it's a central requirement. OpenTalk provides specialized features and moderation tools specifically developed for such demanding scenarios. This includes features voting, recording, streaming, breakout rooms and a coffee break timer. Don't worry: thanks to its user-friendly design and simple operation, OpenTalk is also accessible to users who are not tech-savvy. OpenTalk has been created as a comprehensive European — and therefore GDPR-compliant — alternative for collaboration and communication. It is a video conferencing solution well-suited for agencies, municipalities, administrations as well as personal and business use. Starting with the history of the OpenTalk project, this talk will provide insights into features that set it apart from other solutions, its service architecture and the current state of development. We will also discuss about the efforts of creating tooling for developers to build their own service and client integrations for the system. We have the vision of building and fostering a community around the project that helps creating an open ecosystem.",

CryptPad aims at providing an user-friendly interface, hiding the technicalities from end users, letting them focus on the document content instead. However, the nowaday use of cryptography in CryptPad sometimes clashes with simplicity of use. Fortunately, the NLnet foundation helped us prepare the future by sponsoring the Blueprints project. This project allowed us to pinpoint different ways of improvement, some of which will be presented during this talk.",

IT departments looking for such suites are forced to turn towards proprietary solutions such as Microsoft 365 or Google Workplace. However, alternatives are in the building. Among them, openDesk, an initiative lead by the German Ministry of Interior, stands out. This project aims at building a complete Open Source alternative to Microsoft 365, where the software, the integrations, and the infrastructure required for project are to be released under Open Source licences. At the core of this project are several European Open Source software vendors, including Univention (user management), OpenExchange (email), Nextcloud (file management), Element (chat), Collabora (document editing), OpenProject (project management) and XWiki (knowledge management). This presentation will focus on describing the project, its governance, and describe how its different actors organize in order to foster integrations within Open Source products, and thus create a usable platform on top of them. The last part of the talk will show a demo of the current version of openDesk. https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/opendesk/info",

Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on. The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges. For example, there are problems with: In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has. Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers. Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating. Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers. I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data! I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.",

          "description": "Web Accessibility has a lot of complexities, and most CMS do not have the capacity to invest in it sufficiently. Two years ago Funka organized a Cross-CMS initiative to look at supporting content authors in their efforts to produce accessible content. This EC funded initiative, the We4Authors Cluster brought together Drupal, Joomla, Plone, and Umbreco. This is the only cross-CMS accessibility event I am aware of where maintainers collaborated on common UI elements. It is also the only one I am aware of where user research was done on authors, to help evaluate accessibility. We need more of this. Currently, Environmental Sustainability in the CMS space is given even less of a priority than accessibility. We are in a climate crisis, digital tools are contributing to it, global best practices are emerging, but adoption of these best practices isn't happening fast enough. Collaboration is needed to both raise awareness within our industry, but also find common solutions. Finding common approaches to measure the CO2 impact is an important starting point. Much more will be needed if we are to help the web make significant reductions in energy consumption. These are two places where collaboration is key if we are able to make the advances which are needed for people with disabilities, as well as future generations. Where can we help to optimize our development process, code execution, and the cumulative impact of CO2 produced through the process.",

          "description": "AletheiaFact.org is a movement for the democratization of fact-checking in Brazil, which aims to empower ordinary citizens to check and monitor information in order to prevent the harmful spread of fake news and create a digital community engaged in teaching, learning and sharing knowledge on the subject. We are also a technological platform that offers tools in workflow format to make fact-checking processes accessible and feasible for everyone. In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, establishing robust and reliable fact-checking platforms is crucial. This presentation delves into the unique journey of developing a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) fact-checking platform specifically for the Brazilian community. We explore the intersection of technology, journalism, and civic engagement in the context of Brazil's diverse and dynamic information landscape. Brazil, with its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, presents unique challenges in misinformation management. Our project aims not only to address these challenges but also to harness the power of the open-source community in creating a transparent and accountable fact-checking tool. We will discuss the technical hurdles in building a scalable and effective platform, including aspects like real-time data analysis, integration with various media formats, and ensuring user-friendly interfaces that cater to a broad audience. Additionally, we focus on the vital role of community engagement in the development and adoption of the platform. The talk will cover strategies for fostering an active open-source community around the project, encouraging collaboration, and ensuring the platform evolves in response to the community's needs.",

          "description": "Lessons learned from changing the governance model of an established open source project after ownership of the project was passed from a company to the community. Picture the scene, you're leading a popular open source project used by tens of thousands of businesses, and suddenly your founding company and primary funder steps back from the project. What will happen to the project? How do we move forward given that all of our governance model and decision making was tied up with the founding company? This session will explore some of the governance challenges that faced Mautic when this situation arose back in April 2023, and in particular we'll dive into more detail on how we developed an entirely new governance model and decision making process. We will touch on issues including how we actually went about creating a new community-driven governance model in a collaborative way, allowing members of the community to have a say, through to the practicalities of how we implemented our new Community Portal for democratic decision making. This session is for you if you're curious about all things governance and open source, if you'd like to know more about collaborative decision making and how this can be facilitated with open source software.",

Recently there has been a rise of do-ocracy, which means anyone and stand up and do it. Is this the best alternative we can have? Are there downfalls? Goal: This talk can provoke thoughts about what is a better leadership model for open-source projects. We have come a long way to improve diversity and inclusion of the open-source ecosystem but the battle does not stop here. Hopefully, by providing more information and concerns about different types of open-source leadership models, it can help the audience to improve the model in their own project or help those who want to set up new projects a better place to start. Target audiences: Anyone who is involved in any open-source project, as a leader or participant. This talk is also useful for company leadership who wants to start an open-source project or make an existing project open-source.",

          "description": "In this talk I'll share lessons learned over years spent as a program manager and product manager contributing to open source projects, mostly in the cloud native space. I'll explain how backlog refinement, prioritization, roadmapping, user research and data collection, and project management basics can help your project stand out as uniquely valuable in a crowded landscape—drawing from real-world examples. To help you gain clarity on your project's goals and core attributes, I'll talk about how to overcome \"assumption-driven development\" to become a better listener to your users. Throughout, I'll also show you how incorporating product management methods can help you to avoid frustration and burnout, whether you're a maintainer or a contributor. This talk will provide an overview of select techniques used by product managers to drive decision-making, focus, and results-oriented experimentation. These techniques will be presented in a manner that takes into consideration the realities and practicalities of trying to achieve development goals in the open source context. For those of you working in open source as part of your day jobs, I'll also discuss how to align your project's delivery objectives with your employer's product roadmap so that you increase the chances of getting the staffing, support, and recognition you want. By the end, you will hopefully take away new knowledge and insights into how to tame your backlog, surface your core objectives and problems to be solved, make your users happier, and keep yourselves—and your fellow contributors—productive with purpose.",

          "description": "In the Free and Open Source world, compliance often gets a reputation as a complex, back-end process, seemingly distant from the daily workflow of developers and contributors. However, in this talk, we’ll explore how compliance is not just a legal necessity but a communal responsibility that can significantly enhance open-source projects' trust, sustainability, and success. We will delve into the idea that compliance should be a collective effort seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the open-source community. By engaging the core developers, occasional contributors, and end-users, compliance becomes an inclusive, transparent process that upholds the spirit of open collaboration and innovation.",

Is open source less interesting than it was when the Open Source Initiative was created 25 years ago? Or is it just a short-sighted, investor-driven move to extract incrementally more value to the detriment of the whole ecosystem? In this talk, Thierry Carrez, General Manager at the OpenInfra Foundation and vice-chair at the Open Source Initiative, will look critically at those recent developments. He will replace them in historical context, explain the origin and value of the permissionless innovation that we currently all enjoy, and reassert the virtue of software developed in an open collaboration, compared to single-vendor software.",

          "description": "While investment in AI compliance and strategy continues to grow, numerous layoffs of open source talent are happening within organizations. This talk aims to explore the critical role of open source talent in providing stewardship and building bridges between an organization's AI strategy and its critical infrastructure. The talk will also highlight the risks to the software (and AI) supply chain arising from inadequate support for open source communities, potentially creating vulnerabilities in the entire cycle. Open source is integral to software development, and AI models are no exception. The open source community, leveraging its collaborative model, has significantly contributed to the AI ecosystem. This includes the development of frameworks used to build models, standards, or the sharing of datasets that train these models. Such contributions have enabled the creation of both open source and proprietary AI models, as evidenced by organizations like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and NVIDIA.

But let's take a look at what questions (or risks) an open approach may carry. In the Česko.Digital community, we have more than 6000 members from different areas. There are volunteers, people from non-profits or public administration, representatives of various businesses, supporters, and more. Since the beginning, we have built our community on open principles in many aspects of our functioning. However, we have reached a point where we are running into the possible limits of this approach. In the past months, we have been looking for answers (not only) to the questions stated above, and I would like to share with you the insights from our journey.",

We’ll touch on what place Accelerators and Grants have in this, and peeling away the growth-curve expectations from investors who may, or may not, understand the needs of free and open source. Let’s start 2024 with the crucial question: how do we ensure the software our societies depend on is sustainable long-term?",

          "description": "We’ve heard it for decades - being an open source maintainer is full-time job in itself. Writing features and maintaining the project are expected, but a project needs more than good features to create a robust community around it. Open source organizational design is usually an after thought but it doesn’t have to be. Taking the time to define those “hats” early on can help a project grow and be sustainable enough to not rely on a few maintainers to do it all. In this session, Paris Pittman will share her experience helping maintainers avoid burnout, handle governance operations, increase adopters, and building plans for community. Is moderating your mailing list or chat platform something you want to do for the duration of the project as a lead maintainer? What about creating and writing all of the onboarding materials needed for contributors and users alike? In this session, we will draw from open source projects like Kubernetes, Swift, and others so that audience members will take away an action plan on building out intentional community roles, groups, and more so the many hats of maintainers are shared.",

          "description": "Many companies are understanding the value of having open source contributors and maintainers within their ranks. Growing that open source culture internally is not quite as easy as simply hiring developers to “work on open source” and pointing them at a GitHub repository. Martin and Phil both became open source contributors and, ultimately, maintainers in the past decade with the support of company efforts to increase contributors. They both learned a lot of open source lessons along the way and are taking that knowledge into leadership and specific mentoring roles at IBM and AWS today. In this talk, Martin and Phil will provide guidance for both employees and technical leaders who are looking to invest in growing an open source culture where they work. We’ll help detail the ways that open source investment is valuable both for the company and for the employee’s own vitality and career advancement. We’ll share how our own open source journeys have unlocked career opportunities that may have been unavailable to us before, and how we are investing in others through various programs and career mentoring at our respective companies today.",

          "description": "OSPOs (Open Source Program Offices) are on the rise: from private companies, to public administrations and academia, organisations now often have someone or a team dedicated to open source topics. The idea behind an OSPO is not only to secure open source assets; it's also about being a good citizen, contributing back, and become an active part of the community and ecosystem. The OSPO Alliance published in 2021 the first version of the Good Governance Handbook, a method and framework to help organisations define and build their OSPO. It proposes a list of 25 good practices, from identification of open source assets to HR contracts and community participation, all packed with practical advice and resources from experienced practitioners. We also provide a deployment feature to start your own OSPO in less than 10mn using GitLab. During this session, we will present the latest version of the GGI Handbook (v1.2), how it helps both organisations and the open source community, and start a discussion about how we can help them -- public sector, academia, NGOs, private orgs.. -- become better citizens, adopt good practices and contribute back to our ecosystem.",

Drawing on the speaker's experience building cloud native communities around CNCF, Cilium, and eBPF, this talk is a practical introduction on how to create a place that people want to be. Marketing is a one to many megaphone while community is constructed through a network of one to one relationships. We will break down the steps to develop these relationships from seeding the initial champions to leveraging existing communities to successfully growing beyond the reach of any one single person. The audience will walk away understanding how these one to one relationships and friendships are key to a successful community and how they can create one around their open source project, product, and company too.",

          "description": "Building healthy and vibrant open source communities that are sustained over time can be a struggle, especially when maintainers are already exhausted and overworked with the regular day to day work on the project. It’s not easy, and there is no one size fits all magic solution to building healthy communities. However, there are some strategies you can use to increase your chances of being successful. This talk has three sections. First, a discussion of the strategies that can be employed to build healthy communities, including performing the work in the open and how good governance, contributor ladders, and roadmaps can help you grow diverse contributor communities. Second, how to take a strategic approach to metrics that help you align your unique goals, and build healthy open source communities. Finally, the talk will include tips and techniques for interpreting what the metrics are telling you in ways that allow you to take action to continuously improve the health of your open source communities. This talk focuses on how to take a strategic approach to building FOSS communities and how the smart use of metrics can help you continuously measure your progress and improve community health. Whether you are working in an open source project on behalf of a company or as an individual, you will walk away from this talk with strategies, techniques, and metrics for building healthy communities around your open source projects.",

Working with communities requires lots of soft skills of communicating with many different types of stakeholders, making decisions that represent lots of people, and managing relationships. On top of all of this, systematically growing a community can be difficult. In this talk, I will discuss how Open@RIT has utilized evidence based methodologies to work with open source projects to not only better facilitate maintenance of open source projects, but also to systematically determine what resources (both human and technical) are needed in order to grow and maintain open source communities. You can expect to hear about methods for funding and executing this type of work, attitudes and initiatives that we have found most helpful, and stories from our own experience to help you guide yours.",

          "description": "In the era of cloud systems, it is common practice to outsource most of our data. Consequently, vendors should incorporate several layers of security to ensure users' individual privacy. A typical solution is to protect data at rest by using encryption. To protect data in use, however, encryption is often considered impractical: encrypting and decrypting data at runtime incurs a significant computational overhead. As a remedy, there exist Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that enable database developers to wrap computations in a protected area of the disk. However, the adoption of Open Source software employing TEE to protect data in use is not sufficiently widespread, and such technologies are mostly limited to prototypes. In addition, existing database implementations incorporating TEEs face significant performance issues due to the pitfalls and limitations of Intel SGX, the most commonly used architecture. In this talk, we present the current state of Open Source secure database implementations using TEEs. We will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of widely-known systems (SGX_SQLite, StealthDB, DuckDB) and discuss design choices developers face when using TEEs to secure data. We provide the results of the most recent benchmarks, which expose bottlenecks and tradeoffs. Lastly, we aim to bridge the gap between security and performance by porting our in-house embedded analytical system, DuckDB, to Intel SGX 2. We show preliminary results and open challenges to spread awareness of secure database technologies and encourage their discussion.",

We will cover the benefits of using TEE and fTPM, and additionally, we will provide an example of how to implement that and demonstrate the code. It is important to note that there is already a kernel driver available that supports fTPM in TEE, which can be found in the latest Linux kernel source code [1]. Part of this talk will cover examples available on Microsoft GitHub [2] page which provide a guide on how to implement fTPM on ARM32 platforms. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of how to leverage TEE and fTPM, as well as the knowledge and tools needed to implement fTPM on their embedded systems and enhance their security.

Validating these measurements requires a set of trusted reference values. But where do these opaque values come from? Today, they are often provided by a third party, without mechanisms for auditing the trustworthiness or origin of reference values. We want to make CC offerings auditable, allowing end users to read the source code, reproduce binary artifacts, generate reference values from the artifacts and verify the deployed system (using remote attestation). Every part of the TCB needs to be open source and reproducible. We will cover the status quo of how reference values are used in CC. We show what the main difficulties and sources of non-determinism are. Based on a minimal open source example, we explain how we build fully reproducible OS images with mkosi and nix - all the way from source code in Git to the reference values for remote attestation. The presented code is the base for images used in both Constellation and the Confidential Containers project.",

          "description": "The growing trend towards confidential computing has presented a significant challenge: making remote attestation, a crucial technology for establishing trust in confidential workloads, easily accessible to application developers. Ideally, leveraging the added transparency and security guarantees of attestation as an authentication mechanism should be simple. However, the current ecosystem often requires engineers to integrate remote attestation at the application layer of the network stack. This task is not only burdensome, diverting attention from core business logic, but also poses privacy risks. Developers are compelled to navigate a complex maze of security protocols, with the ever-present danger of accidentally exposing sensitive information about the devices running these workloads. Developing secure and easy-to-use building blocks requires a collaborative effort between the open-source and standards communities. The IETF is working on various specifications, which are being complemented by prototypes and formal verification of innovative features. Several Internet protocols, such as TLS, OAuth, ACME, Netconf, and CSR/EST, are already incorporating attestation, and others will follow. A key focus of our work is to integrate privacy-preserving techniques that can mitigate the risks inherent in remote attestation, ensuring that this crucial technology can be utilized in a manner that is both user-friendly and privacy-conscious. In this presentation, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current standardization and open-source implementation initiatives. The goal is to make it easier for the broader community to access and engage in this new development, which is crucial for the advancement of the remote attestation infrastructure in general and the utilization of confidential computing in particular.",

This talk will delve into the methods of distributing private container images and OCI artifacts, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of various solutions, especially in contexts like software sales and custom builds for clients. We will begin our discussion with hosted registries, highlighting their cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation, and low maintenance needs. Next, we will explore self-hosted solutions, which offer greater flexibility. Finally, we will examine the integration of an OCI-compatible registry with a custom authorization server. This setup allows the incorporation of complex business logic into authorization decisions, such as custom IAM and product subscriptions. While this adaptable and cost-efficient approach may involve custom development, we will provide a thorough analysis of its implications.",

The ability to checkpoint containers opens up many new use cases. Containers can be migrated without loosing the state of the container, fast startup from existing checkpoints, using spot instances more effective. The primary use case, based on the title of the Kubernetes enhancement proposal, is the forensic analysis of the checkpointed containers. In this session I want to introduce the different possible use cases of \"Forensic Container Checkpointing\" with a focus on how to perform forensic analysis on the checkpointed containers. The presented use cases and especially the forensic analysis will be done as a live demo giving the audience a hands on experience.",

Incus is a fully fledged system container and virtual machine manager, capable of running either standalone on systems as small as single board computers, or scale up to hundreds of servers to run tens of thousands of instances. It supports advanced storage and networking options and can easily be managed through its command line, a variety of web UIs or its REST API. In this presentation, we'll be going over a bit of the history of LXD and Incus, how it came to be, who's behind it, what state it's currently in and what to look forward to in the near future!",

          "description": "A common question language runtimes have is: how many resources do I have access to? They want to know e.g. how many threads they can run in parallel for their threadpool size, or the number of thread-local memory arenas, etc. The kernel offers many endpoints to query this information. There is /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/stat, sched_getaffinity(), sysinfo(), the cpuset cgroup hierarchy's cpuset.cpus.effective, the isolcpus kernel command line parameter, /sys/devices/system/cpu/online. Further, libcs offer divergent implementations of sysconf(_SC_NPROCESORS_ONLIN). As a bonus, the kernel scheduler may be configured to limit resources using cpu \"shares\" or cpu quotas, so a task may be able to run on all cores, but have some kind of rate limit that is not reflected in the physical cores the system is allowed to run on. In this talk, we propose a new library \"libamicontained\" to offer one place to consolidate the logic for the answer to this question. We propose a: library which is aware of all of these different runtime configurations and answers questions about cpu counts etc. in accordingly reasonable ways. Of course, the real challenge here is adoption. Ideally we can pitch such a library as \"from the container people\", so it's an easier pitch to language runtimes. We are here seeking feedback on all points (heuristics to reason about CPU counts, design goals, etc.) from container people as a first step. [2]: as of this writing, the jvm still uses cpuset.cpus instead of cpuset.cpus.effective on cgroupv2: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/7fbfb3b74a283261027e6c293e1a5dbc354cf0af/src/hotspot/os/linux/cgroupV2Subsystem_linux.cpp#L92-L96 [3]: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/2297 , https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6252",

We have elected to do so by creating a single LXC container for the application, that contains each rootfs image, and running each process in a chroot, using bind mounts for special directories such as /proc, /dev, /sys, and /run. This reduces the overhead of multiple containers, but could have drawbacks with respect to compatibility between processes from different distributions, and security within the application. As of the time of this talk, we will have tested an implementation of this strategy, and we will report our findings regarding its advantages and disadvantages.",

In v255 the ability for select system services/portable services/containers to survive the reboot uninterrupted was added. On an image-based Linux system this allows atomically updating the rootfs without causing interruptions for workloads that run on discrete and separate filesystem images. This talk will briefly explore this new feature, listing new improvements from the latest version, and showing a demo of a soft-reboot being applied on an Azure Boost machine with two surviving critical portable services running without interruptions while the rest of the OS is restarted. We will explore what container runtimes maintainers would need to do in order to support this feature. systemd-portabled already supports it for Portable Services.",

          "description": "This demo aims to share a convenient setup for maintaining a container environment using Podman and Ansible. The configuration is well-suited for home server applications as it enables the user to efficiently manage media files and execute sysadmin tasks without requiring root access. In particular, delegating the setup to a playbook that does not require root ensures that the system converges to the desired state without the need for a superuser. This short talk focuses on a common scenario where a rootless setup may require remapping UIDs and GIDs, which can be quite challenging to maintain over time. Due to the nature of these use cases, Ansible is frequently one of the best options for setting up, updating, and keeping a system up and running over time. Finally, this presentation covers other common needs of a container setup, such as the need to store secrets, manage services separated into logical units, and reproduce the setup on different systems.",

But as we enter 2024, containerd is continuing with pre-GA releases of a new 2.0 line that includes new features, deprecates a long history of older functionality and hopefully provides a solid basis to take containerd into the future, or at least the next eight years! This talk will walk attendees through new functionality in 2.0, what's changing, and how we continue to make containerd a core, reliable runtime with lots of extensibility. We'll highlight adopters and use cases both old and new, including the new WASM shim, new lazy loading technology, and many others.",

          "description": "eBPF stands as a groundbreaking technology enabling the execution of programs in an isolated space within the kernel of the operating system, operating with privileged access. This technology proves valuable for safely and efficiently expanding the kernel's capabilities without necessitating alterations to the source code or the loading of additional modules. This approach provides direct access to the Linux kernel space, leading to notable improvements in performance. A key facilitator in this landscape is bpfd, a system daemon explicitly designed to streamline the deployment and management of eBPF applications, falling under the umbrella of Extended Berkeley Packet Filter. bpfd boasts an operator specifically crafted for utilization within Kubernetes, allowing users to deploy eBPF programs using a Custom Resource (CR) within a Kubernetes cluster. During our discussion, we will delve into the developmental journey of bpfd, tracing its origins from Aya, a Rust library designed for eBPF development. Our exploration will extend to practical aspects such as leveraging the operator, deploying applications, and understanding how Fedora elevates the user experience as a host. A significant focus will be placed on addressing security concerns pertaining to pods designated for the execution of eBPF applications within Kubernetes. Additionally, we will explore the challenges and outstanding tasks related to integration with Kubernetes, along with insights on collaborative efforts within the eBPF sig-group in Fedora. It's worth noting that eBPF has already been adopted in production environments by prominent companies, including Google, Netflix, Shopify, and Cloudflare. Join us for an insightful discussion on the evolving landscape of eBPF orchestration in Kubernetes and Fedora. bpfman repo bpfd/bpfman documentation Fedora eBPF SIG",

          "description": "Container applications are deployed by creating an instance of a pre-defined container image from declaratively configured properties. This eases automation and reproducibility of deployments, which in turn reduces operational risk. What if we extend these properties to node provisioning, treating the OS itself like a containerised app? What if, instead of making general purpose operating systems fit our needs we radically re-think our approach, from the ground up, on how an OS should handle and work in a cloud native environment? Applying the same expectations we have towards handling of container applications we present an alternative approach to OS provisioning, configuration, and lifecycle management. Leveraging a strict separation of OS and applications, we show how a zero-touch, immutable, image-based OS can be built. And extending this concept, we make builds attestable and deployments cryptographically secure, thus helping to secure your infrastructure’s supply chain. In this talk we will cover some of the latest thinking in operating systems, going beyond the established concept of a Container Linux to a future based on the latest developments in systemd’s composable images and a generic model for image-based architectures.",

We'll start by taking a look at what an OCI container image is, before delving into the different options for assembling them. After understanding why things are the way they are, we'll dive into some of the options for achieving vastly faster build times and smaller images. We'll also look at supply chain concerns such as SLSA, SBOMs and attestations. We'll explore buildkit, buildpacks, Dagger, ko, Apko, Rockcraft and Nix amongst other technologies.

          "description": "Containers have undoubtedly taken the lead in the landscape of cloud-native applications, but their security limitations have prompted a revisit to conventional VMs. This renewed interest revolves around implementing additional security measures, particularly by confining containers within VM or microVM sandboxes. While this approach offers enhanced security, it introduces complexities in effectively optimizing resources on physical nodes. On the other hand, unikernels emerge as a compelling alternative —- a streamlined application kernel that preserves the benefits of VM isolation. However, the challenge lies in seamlessly integrating unikernels into the existing container ecosystem. In this talk we present urunc, a CRI-compatible container runtime that spawns unikernels, packaged in OCI images. We dig in the internals of urunc, providing insights into support for various hypervisors, network and storage handling, as well as the integration with high-level orchestration frameworks (such as k8s). At the same time, we elaborate on the network setup implications when unikernels and generic containers are mixed in the context of k8s.",

Nevertheless overlay networks, like I2P (\"Invisible Internet Project\") do have the need for a DNS. Also, by definition, there is nothing like trust between peers of such a network. Typically such a problem might be solved using a distributed storage layer driven by a byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm. After the first prototype in 2022 (presented at FOSDEM 2023) the project has improved and a new version of the storage layer and also the DNS logic is available for FOSDEM 2024.",

The studies of economics and econometrics at the University of Zurich helped him creating very early high frequency trading bots back in the 90s. In 2003 he co-founded a small SaaS-model based company in Switzerland, which reached market leadership in the sector a few years later. After 2015 Konrad and his partner decided to leave corporate life behind and to dedicate their time and knowledge to privacy- and freedom-related technology projects.\nSince 2022 Konrad is also lecturer at University of Applied Science and Arts, Lucerne, Switzerland, teaching \"Distributed Systems and Microservices\". He talks and teaches about free/libre software.\nKonrad dedicates most of his time and knowledge to the development of free software (like AGPL or better) software. This work is done within the non-profit and open association \"diva.exchange\". It is today a recognized research institution cooperating with universities by funding and supporting research projects."

          "description": "Domain names are not just web addresses; they are the lifeline of digital navigation and identity. But how many professionals are fully conversant with the technical aspects of domains names? There's a lot of room for doubts and errors. Often neglected, zones are complex to handle. Yet, they are nonetheless crucial, helping individuals to better control their private lives on the Internet. HappyDomain aims at simplifying domain management, making them accessibles for everyone. From individuals safeguarding their private lives online, to experienced system administrators overseeing vast digital landscapes. You’ll learn how we try to promote a domain for everyone, with an interface finally designed for humans. In 2024, what features should we expect to help us in our DNS-related tasks?",

Advanced DNS resolvers have many good features, but each has different configuration syntax even for basic settings like forwarding. We think integration can be provided by dnsconfd daemon, which would provide glue between Network Manager and resolver running on localhost. Would provide unified DBus and command line interface for different cache implementations.",

          "description": "In the spring of 2011, Namecoin, a blockchain-based DNS system, was launched. It was the first blockchain created after Bitcoin, and the only one supported by Satoshi before his disappearance. Namecoin uses a blockchain both to hold the names registry data and to automate the registration process itself. In the 13 years that passed since its inception, the field had additional strides of innovation, courtesy of projects such as Handshake or ENS. Recently, blockchain name systems have surged in popularity, with each blockchain having its own name system, some with a thriving developer's base and users communities. In this talk, we survey the evolution of blockchain name systems from Namecoin to the present day. The talk will focus on projects contributing technical or conceptual innovations to this field.",

Business Logic Purity: Striving for purity in business logic to ensure most functions are inherently testable, promoting a more robust and reliable system. Traceability of Data Changes: Elevating the tracking of data changes to a pivotal role within our system, treating it as a fundamental aspect of our architecture.

          "description": "Subtitle: Continuous Evolution Keeps 1960s Technology Alive Short Abstract: M is a conceptually simple language tightly coupled to a conceptually simple database. Originally developed in the mid to late 1960s, the technology has evolved to stay relevant in the 21st century. The talk reviews the history of the technology, the conceptual simplicity of both the M language and M database, and how the technology survives by evolving to adapt to the changing world of computing. Portability was a goal since its earliest days. Longer Description: M first ran on a PDP-7 and was a complete software stack: an operating system, a database, and a language. To run on such limited hardware, M seamlessly coupled a minimalistic database with a minimalistic language. It was based on a small number of concepts. Fast forward more than a half century. While M is not mainstream software technology, it is the language and database of the largest real-time core-banking and electronic medical record systems. For example, a nation-scale medical record system in Jordan runs a complete FOSS stack developed in M. To robustly and securely serve such large-scale, mission-critical systems that require \"five nines\" availability, M has retained its core principles of a minimalistic language and efficient implementation, which allows it to scale down as well as up: the YottaDB implementation of M delivers thousands of database accesses per second even on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a consumer grade MicroSD card. To remain relevant with changing economics and technology, M had to evolve. It moved from days when the cost of the hardware dominated, programmers were economical, and software was freely bundled with the hardware, to today. It has done so without compromising its foundational values. It ceased to be an operating system as it was ported to other computing platforms. A production grade implementation was released under a copyleft license in 2000/2001. While the M language retains its conceptual simplicity, the tight coupling of M, the language, with M, the database, now extends to other languages, C, Go, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, and Rust. The talk will use examples from lua-yottadb, which tightly binds a highly capable minimalistic language and a highly capable minimalistic database. Links:",

His current work focuses on database engines with NoSQL+SQL access, used in secure, mission-critical applications such as large-scale core-banking and electronic medical records, but which also scales down to edge computing. 100% of his software, both professional and personal, is released under free / open source software licenses.\nBhaskar has used Linux as his primary computing environment since 1999, at work and at home."

          "description": "The behaviour of repos over time will be examined from the perspective of semantic graphs and qualifying annotations. The focus will not only be concerning direct diffs within a specific commit but emphasizing greater contextualization of what was taking place. For example, understanding the relationship of a commit in the context of a project's sections; functionality; or symbiotic repos. Through the use of logic programming (SWI-Prolog) and the useful of (RDF) principles, demonstrations will include: * How historic changes to files in a VCS should not be treated as logs of affect but additionally as components for adapting other coding and knowledge assets; * How failure to preemptively describe the desired outcomes from a successful commit mean that there is a failure to provide preparatory automation behaviours. The aforementioned logic programming and RDF expositions will demonstrate the evolution of the (historically NLNet funded) project Icebreaker. It shall be mixing its parsing syntaxes from seperate projects (kanban boards and knowledge-management with syntaxes for time series analyses of repos). There will be a showing of how task management; documentation; and coding intersect using perspectives from how annotations from the \"Recursive-Modelling-Language\" Qiuy intersect over time. Anybody who has lost an afternoon because of a 1 character mistake in their coding understands the grim insights from the proverb \"For Want of a Nail\". However, for non coding activities such errors or omittances are more subtle, as the fallout from things tends to be less direct (such as for lost capacity, imprecision or diminished returns). To return to the proverb, the nail is the instigator of a chain of events, rather than a technical or procedural. People are unlikely to posit \"For Want of Annealing\" to highlight the pernicious effects of qualified deficiencies. The consequence of this presentation will be to demonstrate how underutilized qualitative and graph orientated approaches are for modern project management.",

          "description": "Last year, I presented DB48X, an open-source firmware for the DM42 and DM32 calculators from SwissMicros (https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/reversepolishlisp). The goal is to create the best scientific programmable calculator for engineers, based on (and improving upon) the user experience of calculators such as the HP48 series. The DM42 has a serious limitation: there is about 700K of available flash space for the program, and about 70K of available RAM. So the question is: how much math can we fit in 700K. This year, I would like to demonstrate what already works, including support for: * big integers * based numbers * complex numbers * vectors and matrices * symbolic computations * integration and differentiation * engineering units * plots and charts * data processing * RPL programming and debugging The focus of the talk would be on how to use C++ to write really compact and efficient code, notably three interesting points: 1/ C++ and garbage collection? Huh? (The DB48X object model) 2/ Using template meta-programming to generate data tables representing symbolic expressions and RPL programs 3/ Performance tuning vs. code space I will also share some of the funniest or most interesting bugs I ran into (e.g.: It runs on USB power, but halts when on battery)",

          "description": "As free software programmers, whether we like it or not, we often host our projects on large centralized and proprietary software forges such as GitHub. In theory, it is perfectly possible to host our own forges using free software such as GitLab, Gitea, etc. But, life is short, and setup and maintenance of these services is more work than it seems at first. GNU Guix is well-known as a package manager, for the high quality of its packages, and for the strong reproducibility guarantees it provides. But, it is much less appreciated for its services, system definitions and deployment features. That's such a shame since these features can let you summon and dismiss entire systems at will—be they bare-metal or virtualized—with nothing but a declarative plain text configuration file. In this talk, I will speak about guix-forge, a Guix channel that provides Guix services for easy setup and maintenance of a software forge. guix-forge uses existing free software such as cgit and/or klaus for serving git repositories on the web, laminar and webhook for continuous integration, uacme for managing TLS certificates, etc.",

From a being just a wild idea back in 2019, the language has grown into a small community of users (roughly measured by its ~1.8k GitHub stars). With growth, the language's strengths and weaknesses became more evident, and with those come feature requests. How to keep the language small and still address the needs of users, while remaining faithful to the spirit of Lua and not falling into pitfalls from the past? In this talk we'll discuss some pragmatic choices in Teal's design that were made to balance those concerns: to make it more powerful, while keeping it small.",

          "description": "Open Source technology, practices, and thinking have revolutionized how we innovate, collaborate, and do business. The impact goes beyond our daily work — it is everywhere — we won! But there's a downside: We have forgotten to tell people what makes us and Open Source different. We must remember how radical and important Open Source is. It is extraordinary that we build international communities of experts sharing our best ideas, building businesses, and creating value. Open Source — and we — have the potential to create more positive change in the world. And we need to tell the world, again. At the same time, proprietary systems and vendors are winning pitches in government and elsewhere that should be no-brainers for Open Source solutions. What comes next, and what do we have to do to make sure we can continue to make a positive difference with Open Source in the future? This session will explore open source at different scales, from small but meaningful, to vast and vital to our future. What has open source made possible? What have we done with it in the last 24 years? A look back at our origins, the changes and opportunities open source has enabled from small and personal to large. What could applying open source philosophy and practices — \"thinking open source\" — bring to society, the world, and the future beyond our daily work and business, from promoting peaceful and democratic societies to providing international development aid? Openness and sharing, good governance and democracy. Can open source practice teach us how to live in a peaceful, free, and democratic society? SAID ABOUT THIS TALK: “This session came with the best value I've experienced myself for ages. I'm so glad I went there, the impact of FOSS principles to our societies is totally underrated. It was overwhelming!”",

This hampers accessibility for both students, who want to familiarize themselves with a CMS project, and teachers, who want to define an effective curriculum. Having access to concise skill definitions for a CMS project helps teaching it, helps identify required learning goals and shows what a person already knows when starting to learn about CMS. SkillDisplay wants help creating a shared standard, highlighting similarities and synergies between different CMS projects, offering people easier access to FOSS technologies.",

          "description": "Accessibility is a key requirement in modern web applications — not only because of new legislative requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), but because it is also a human right and a cornerstone of an inclusive society. This presentation aims to shed light on the on the different kinds of barriers a user might encounter in a modern web application (especially in the context of the \"usual suspects\" of content management systems like Wordpress or TYPO3), and also show that there are some barriers that all users may encounter, regardless of their physical or mental ability. Instead, some barriers may arise from the technology available to a user (who possibly only has access to a low-end device, works with a spotty network connection or does not have access to a required input device), the education of a user, their language comprehension and many other factors. We will explore key accessibility principles to allow users to overcome these barriers and share real-world practical examples to illustrate the impact of accessible design on user experience and inclusivity. We will provide actionable strategies for developers and UX designers to enhance accessibility working with or on these CMS frameworks. Attendees will gain insights into optimizing software and content for diverse user needs, ensuring compliance with global accessibility standards and regulatory requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), and leveraging the latest technologies to create a more inclusive digital landscape.",

Wagtail is an open source, Django-powered Content Management System (CMS). It is built on the concept of pages as tree-structured database models. In recent years, its content management features have been extracted to not only work on page models, but any arbitrary database model. We will explore how these features work and how they were implemented in Wagtail. We will also discuss how they can fit in other CMSs.

It often leads to projects struggling to find a good way to make money, and sadly, some great projects end up failing because they run out of resources. That's where this session comes in: Attendees at the presentation will gain insights into the financial support mechanisms behind this open-source CMS. The goal is to equip them with the knowledge to extend this initiative to benefit other free software projects.",

Beyond the minimum effort to provide basic SecureBoot compatibility most distributions haven't (yet) delivered tangible benefits to users. In this talk I'd like to give an overview on how distributions can reasonably jump on the system integrity train, that makes the boot process and OS somewhat proof to offline attacks, and allows them to catch up with similar functionality that other commercial OSes have already been providing for a while. This talk will be from a systemd perspective, and focus on the various OS integrity components we now provide, and how to put them together, with a focus on keeping things nicely generic, democatric, and modular without compromising security. Specifically, we'll touch immutable initrds, UKIs, full disk encryption policies, TPM, and Measured Boot vs. Secure Boot, and more, → systemd Homepage",

          "description": "Join us for a discussion aimed at supporting Linux distribution developers in enhancing accessibility. As blind software engineers, we believe we can bring a unique perspective to this essential endeavor. We'll explore the challenges faced by blind users when using the Linux desktop environment, with a focus on constructive solutions. We will discuss two main topics: lack of preinstalled assistive technologies and accessibility problems of basic components of desktop environments. Our goal is to offer guidance and encouragement to developers, empowering them to create more inclusive experiences for all users. In our vision for the ideal accessibility scenario, Linux distributions seamlessly accommodate the needs of blind users. To achieve this, we'll stress the importance of collaboration among developers and upstream projects, ensuring that accessibility becomes a fundamental consideration in the development process. Additionally, we'll introduce the \"Linux Accessibility Guide\", a valuable resource that can assist developers in making graphical applications more accessible. This guide will offer practical insights and best practices to support their efforts. Join us as we embark on a journey to improve the accessibility of Linux distributions, fostering an environment where accessibility is a shared goal, benefiting blind users and the entire Linux community. Together, we can create a more accessible and inclusive Linux desktop experience.",

          "description": "There's been quite a bit of excitement around Enterprise Linux over the last few years, and that's made some people quite nervous, and others downright angry. This has left many confused about the state of Enterprise Linux. In open source, transparency, and sharing of ideas is critical. But it's more than just what you share, it's how you share it. This talk will delve into the state of Enterprise Linux from Red Hat's perspective and share it in a community driven way. The upstream and downstream relationships that make up the RHEL supply chain contribute to what is arguably the largest and most sophisticated open source supply chain in the world. This large, sophisticated supply chain, and all of the Independent Software Developers (ISVs) involved, give RHEL a lot of gravity, probably more than any other open source product. For years, I think many of us in the open source world assumed that we knew everything there was to know about open source, but the truth is, we’re all still learning. In the last couple of years, there have been some big changes in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) supply chain, often referred to as Enterprise Linux or EL for short. This talk will try to share a representative opinion from Red Hat about where we see Enterprise Linux today, where we think it's going, and where we'd like to take it.",

          "description": "Generally, initrd images have always been constructed by picking various files from the host filesystem, with various bespoke mechanisms to figure out all the dependencies that have to accompany said files. Instead, we propose to build initrd images out of distribution packages. This results in initrds that behave more like a regular Linux system, making them more reliable. In this talk, we'll present mkosi-initrd, a project to build initrds out of distribution packages using mkosi (https://github.com/systemd/mkosi), systemd's image builder sister project. While it started as a Fedora project , mkosi-initrd has recently gained support for Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, CentOS, RHEL, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux and Arch Linux. We'll discuss the new distribution-independent implementation, what's implemented and what's still missing. We'll also give a brief introduction on mkosi itself. We're hoping to start a discussion on what it would take for popular distributions to consider adopting this approach to building initrds and to leave FOSDEM with new ideas on how to improve the project.",

          "description": "Have you already thought about how the applications we develop get distributed to end users? Often developers only provide the source code. So for not so tech-savvy users the major distributions need to pick up projects and package it, and maintain it for new releases. This is why there is a need for distribution-independent, secure, and easy-to-use packaging, like on smartphones. This exists also for Linux ... Among the options, there is Snap! Applications are easy to find in the Snap Store and they are installable on most Linux distributions. And, to make Linux even easier for end users, we cannot only provide applications in the Snap format, but also have an all-Snap operating system, Ubuntu Core Desktop, an immutable core operating system based on Snap. And here we do not only have Snaps of desktop applications, but also system applications and components (like the printing stack), the kernel, the desktop environment (like GNOME or KDE), the boot loader, and the core system. So everything can get easily updated or replaced by alternatives, and in case of failure one can easily revert (on boot failure we revert automatically). All this is based on the knowledge and experience we gained at Canonical when creating the smartphone operating system Ubuntu Touch. After the phone project having been discontinued we started with the IoT system Ubuntu Core, snapped desktop applications, ... More about Snap: The Powers, The People https://snapcraft.io/",

Isn’t it? “No extra file in my git!” “I have my own script and it works the best for my use case!” Have you heard sentences like these? When working on Packit (upstream integration for Fedora Linux), we’ve collected various complaints and excuses why people don’t want to integrate upstream and downstream. For example: “we don’t care about users from that distro”, “RPM is complicated”, or “Fedora packaging workflow is hard”. During the talk, we will go through these and provide suggestions on what you can do in such situations and how to bring the best benefit both to developers and maintainers. The talk is suitable for people working on any integration between upstream projects and developers, but also for curious people on both sides to understand the benefit of collaboration.",

          "description": "Starting with glibc-2.33, glibc grew the capability to search for shared libraries using additional paths, based on the hardware capabilities of the machine running the code. This was great for x86_64 (and also powerpc64le and s390x), which was first released in 2003 and has seen many changes in the capabilities of the hardware since then. While it is extremely common for Linux distributions to compile for a baseline which encompasses all of an architecture, there was a lot of performance being left on the table by targeting such an old specification and not one of the newer revisions. Some distributions have opted to increase the baseline to x86-64-v2 or even -v3, but even there you are potentially leaving performance on the table while removing some of the older machines from being able to run on your distribution. By targeting all of the psABI targets you don't remove the option of using old hardware while still providing optimized libraries for newer hardware, and you have happier users getting more out of their hardware.",

Yes, almost all the release cycle is public, anyone interested into building and releasing complex systems such as Linux based Operating System are invited to join. Flatcar is a Linux based OS designed to run container workloads: no package manager, /usr is read-only - it is the responsibility of the maintainers to keep the system up-to-date. From the definition of the content, to the payload release, passing by the \"go/no-go\" meeting let's see how Flatcar is defined, built and released and how the community is involved at each steps.",

Image builder supports the Fedora, CentOS Stream, and RHEL distributions for a host of target platforms such as bare metal, QEMU, vSphere and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure and Google cloud. It can build rpm ostree based images or \"plain\" dnf. It is shipped in a variety of ways: as a CLI tool, a cockpit plugin or a hosted service. We will take a look at the basic concepts, some of the features, and a new initiative targeted towards the Fedora community. Tired of your duct taped collection of scripts to build your images?

          "description": "Chimera Linux is a novel Linux distribution built around FreeBSD core tools and the LLVM toolchain. Since its initial launch in 2021, it has made a lot of progress and is now in alpha stage. The system can be deployed on a wide array of hardware and many people are using it as their desktop system; it works on x86_64, AArch64, POWER (little and big endian) as well as RISC-V and by now comes with thousands of packages. While trying to be practical, Chimera is also highly hardened, partly thanks to the LLVM toolchain, rendering it immune to various security issues other distros are vulnerable to. It has transparent and robust infrastructure, ensuring smooth deployment of packages. We are also developing various new tooling that the whole ecosystem can benefit from, including the Turnstile session tracker. Service management is based around Dinit, a modern, supervising system; we maintain and create a variety of tooling around it, trying to break the existing status quo with systemd, while abandoning legacy approaches. 2023 has seen several major milestones, so I will focus on these, while also giving a short overview so that people unfamiliar with the system don't feel lost. I will also explain how our work benefits the entire Linux ecosystem, as well as beyond.",

          "description": "In 2023, embedded Linux developers received eagerly awaited news: the release of Raspberry Pi 5 and the integration of VNC backend into Weston, the reference compositor for the Wayland display server protocol. During this talk we will explore VNC backend integration in Weston 12 and newer versions as well as its build and runtime dependencies such as NeatVNC and AML. We will compare VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). Using the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded, we are going to build core-image-weston for Raspberry Pi 5 and configure VNC with TLS security and user authentication. Step-by-step tutorial will be provided to demonstrate the configuration of a remote connection to Raspberry Pi 5 from another computer through Vinagre, an open-source VNC client designed for the GNOME Desktop. The presentation is appropriate for anyone interested in remote access to embedded Linux devices. It will expand upon Leon’s lightning talk about RDP from FOSDEM 2023 and address frequently asked questions about remote screen sharing on embedded Linux devices. Previous experience is not required.",

At the same time linux distributions for industrial embedded computer are often based on Yocto/OpenEmbedded or buildroot. This talks will explore what is required to install and run a non modified Debian in an industrial arm/arm64 embedded device running the U-Boot bootloader. We will investigate the various option to install Debian, either running debian-installer (from network or from an external storage media) or using debootstrap, we will look into how the bootloader is loading the OS (kernel, initrd and devicetree), looking at U-Boot distroboot/Standard Boot and UEFI and after that we will have a look at the required support from the Linux kernel. During the talk we will also describe the steps needed to contribute support for a specific board to Debian.",

          "description": "Support for hardware video codecs has been around in V4L2 since the memory-to-memory (M2M) framework was merged in 2010. While it initially allowed support for firmware-driven stateful implementations, it did not cover the case of stateless hardware codecs where the kernel has to configure hardware blocks directly instead of relying on a (proprietary) firmware. Stateless video decoding became supported in 2018 after Bootlin's successful crowdfunding campaign targeting Allwinner platforms. The only remaining piece missing after this work was support for stateless video encoders. This talk will present the current effort to bring support for stateless video encoders in mainline V4L2. This includes an overview of the current preliminary work on selected hardware platforms and video codecs as well as a brief summary of today's out-of-tree support. It will be followed by an introduction to the difficult process of creating a new userspace API to support them in mainline Linux, the inherent trade-offs that need arbitration and why this is taking time to converge.",

          "description": "Many recent Windows (on ARM and x86) laptops have replaced the standard UVC USB camera module with a raw MIPI camera-sensor using a CSI receiver and ISP in the CPU to process the raw data into an image. Both the hw interface of the ISP as well as the image processing algorithms used are often considered a trade secret by CPU vendors. This makes supporting these cameras under Linux a big challenge and so far these cameras are not supported. Both Linaro and Red Hat have identified this as a problem. Linaro has started a project to add a SoftwareISP component to libcamera to allow these cameras to work without needing proprietary software and Red Hat has joined Linaro in working on this. These exact same problems with MIPI cameras are also seen in embedded and automotive uses and the new SoftISP is also targeting these. This talk will present and demo the current state of the SoftwareISP as well as present future plans. We hope there will be plenty of community feedback, so we will leave ample time for questions and discussions at the end.",

          "description": "The barcode scanner market is a walled garden hostile to flexibility. Vendors enforce their proprietary SDKs or applications, documentation is often limited or missing, sometimes it is even required to sign a contract before getting software access to purchased devices. This locks the user inside a single ecosystem, as switching to a different option would mean rewriting software specific to the device. enioka Scan is an open-source Android library enabling users to choose the device vendors that really fit their criteria at any given time. It exposes a single API compatible with all supported scanning devices, working on top of a vendor-specific SDKs made open-source whenever possible. The library handles per-device specifics, so the user can focus on the functional aspects of their application. It is also designed to be easily extended with more support for devices not yet compatible. In this presentation, we will go over the causes of vendor lock-in in the context of barcode scanning devices. After a quick history of the project, we will have an overview of how the library works and how it manages to handle devices from different vendors. We will then take a look at \"quick start\" guide on how to reverse engineer a proprietary SDK to integrate it into the library. Finally, we will explain how you can contribute to this project, and why your help matters.",

Current robotic stack are often overly complex, and hard to integrate with latest technologies. dora-rs is a dataflow framework that can be programmed with Rust/Python/C/C++, it supports: - zero-copy messaging using shared memory with apache arrow format. - manages logs metrics and tracing using opentelemetry. - provide a ROS2 bridge to support legacy software. We hope to make robotic just work! In the same sense that Web Dev, Game Dev, or Cloud development most of the time just work. And with the avent of Large Language Model (LLM), we can implement whole new way to interact with robot like implementing new functionality in real time by natural language!

          "description": "When building an automotive software stack, a central component is to establish an abstraction layer for uniformly exchanging data between deeply embedded vehicle-specific systems and high-level applications. This abstraction benefits many use cases by making it easier to build and port applications and transfer data away from the vehicle. The Automotive Grade Linux Project (AGL) adopted the data broker from Eclipse Kuksa.val as an abstraction layer to leverage the advantages of a standardized description of vehicle signals, like the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). In this talk, we explain the integration of Eclipse Kuksa in AGL by presenting several use cases. We further showcase ongoing developments in both projects, like a new Eclipse Kuksa Android SDK.",

          "description": "This talk describes the issues and challenges I faced during the development of the bxCAN driver on stm32f4/7 architectures for the Linux kernel. Focused on the design and development of the driver, I soon realized that the classic user space tools used for testing a CAN interface (i. e. iproute2 and can-utils) could not be compiled on MMU-less systems. The lack of MMU prevents the use of the fork() system call used by many Linux applications. Currently in buildroot, for example, about half of the packages are not supported on MMU-less systems. Furthermore, considering that busybox also does not support the 'ip link' command for the CAN interface, it was evident that the number of difficulties to overcome had increased so that, in addition to the driver development, the user space also needed to be patched. My target expanded: I definitively wanted to overcome the limitations of the user space and make it available to the open-source community. How has the development of the bxCAN driver evolved? Was it later merged into the Linux kernel? Which packages needed to be patched to test it? What patches were applied? What happened to them? The talk addresses these and other questions that we will explore.",

Zephyr integrates open-source and security best practices to ensure a vendor-neutral, secure, and reliable platform. In this talk, Mohammed Billoo will describe the process of getting to Zephyr to run on the UPduino (https://tinyvision.ai/pages/the-upduino), flashed with the neorv32 RISC-V processor (https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32). He will walk through building and flashing the neorv32 RISC-V core on the FPGA, creating a Zephyr application that can output Hello World to the UART, and loading the application to the FPGA. Mohammed will also walk through the necessary Zephyr drivers to get the application running. This talk will demonstrate how combining RISC-V and Zephyr on an FPGA opens up new opportunities for embedded software applications. Using open-source software and firmware on a low-cost FPGA reduces the bar for entry for enthusiasts and hobbyists. The audience will learn the following in this talk:",

          "description": "It was a long weekend in May 2020. Like many of my human siblings stuck at home with time on their hands due to an ongoing pandemic, I was busy trying to perfect my bread recipe. Fast forward to a few hours later, I had assembled an Arduino-based “artificial nose” that used a gas sensor and AI (so-called TinyML) to learn and detect scents (hence potentially the smell of a perfectly fermented sourdough starter). As I open-sourced and started to share the project on social media, it went viral… and I felt like an impostor, as most of the code powering it was, frankly, hackish. Or maybe it wasn’t, as it had the merit of having helped me invent something new, in literally a few hours. In this talk I will walk you through some of the key features of the artificial nose, and how I eventually rewrote my original code to leverage Zephyr (an open-source real-time operating system) in order to make it easier for myself and the community to extend the project, and run it on a variety of hardware targets. You will learn, among other things: * How to move from a complex “super loop” to well architected threads and event-based programming ; * How to run TinyML models (ex. TensorFlow Lite) while not compromising the rest of your embedded system ; * How to build an efficient and easy-to-maintain graphical user interface ; * How to leverage Zephyr hardware-abstraction layer. All the code and demonstrations shown in the talk is open source and available on GitHub, and you are very much encouraged to go ahead and build your own artificial nose after the presentation!",

          "description": "Edge computing is becoming increasingly popular for applications that require low latency and high bandwidth. However, building edge computing infrastructure that is both scalable and cost-effective can be challenging. In this talk, we will explore how Project Akri and WebAssembly can be used together to build highly scalable edge computing solutions. We will start by introducing Project Akri, an open-source project that provides a standard way to discover and interact with IoT devices at the edge of the network. We will then discuss how WASM, can be used to run code at the edge of the network, providing a lightweight and portable runtime environment for edge applications. We will also cover some use cases where Project Akri and WASM can be used together, such as building ML models that can run on edge devices or processing sensor data in real-time. Attendees of this talk will gain a better understanding of how the above can be used together to build scalable, cost-effective edge.",

          "description": "Flutter is an open-source UI Software Development kit created by Google using the BSD-3-Clause license. It is used for developing multi-platform applications with a single codebase. While traditionally, Flutter has been used for Android and iOS development, it has been steadily gaining market share in the embedded Linux world. While the meta-flutter layer for Yocto has been usable since version 1.17.0 on March 31st, 2020, the Buildroot embedded Linux SDK has only recently added support, starting with Flutter version 3.13.9 on Buildroot version 2023.11. This talk will cover three main points. The first is a brief history of the numerous difficulties that had to be overcome when adding the Flutter packages and infrastructure to Buildroot. This topic covers several idiosyncrasies of obtaining the source code and cross-compiling Flutter, such as how the source code is downloaded, how it is not currently possible to create an automated reproducible tarball when downloading the source code, and generating a tarball because of a reliance on .git files, how every third-party dependency is bundled into the source tarball, and even a patched clang is included in the source tarball that must be used when compiling. The second point covers the advantages and disadvantages of Flutter compared to Qt QML and LVGL. The final point covers how to start and integrate an existing Flutter project into an existing Buildroot infrastructure using the flutter-gallery package as a reference. This includes using an external tree for development purposes, how to profile an application for performance, and problems/concerns to be aware of. If you use or are interested in using Buildroot for your embedded Linux project and are interested in using Flutter for your next project, then this talk is for you!",

This talk aims to show the potential of Flutter on embedded devices, to give a practical guide on how to start developing Flutter with a Raspberry Pi on embedded Linux, and to showcase a project where Flutter connects to the Internet of Things. What's currently supported and what custom Embedder can we use to achieve this? How do we communicate between Flutter and the embedded hardware? How can we integrate and use Flutter in the Maker-Community to open up to the world of IoT? All of these points will be answered in the talk which is accompanied by a working-code example that can be checked out afterwards.",

          "description": "One of the tasks at the device forensics team of the Netherlands Forensic Institute is the reverse engineering of soft- and hardware devices for the judicial system. This task spans a lot of different abstractions in the IT ecosystem, from network protocols, to filesystems, encryption algorithms etc. One very active topic of research is the reverse engineering of low level firmware. This topic proves to be quite a bit more difficult than a lot of others on the list. One of the big challenges in the reverse engineering of low-level firmware is the lack of hardware abstractions and known interfaces (e.g. syscall interfaces and libraries with known exported functions). Furthermore, this type of firmware is oftentimes found in on-die ROM, which provides a good incentive to keep it's size small, as this type of memory can be expensive. This usually means there is not a lot of space for (debug) strings either. These factors making static reverse engineering quite a tough challenge, which in turn makes dynamic reversing more attractive. However, this is not an easy task. The lack of hardware abstractions and the presence of memory-mapped peripherals makes emulation no small feat. Outside of some OSINT and cross-referencing, the best one can do is guess at the working of some of these unknown peripherals. But is there a smarter way of guessing? In this talk, we present CONFEDSS, a project for Concolic Firmware Emulation using Dynamic State Selection. This project aims to make it easier for reverse engineers to dynamically reverse low-level firmware by emulating it and using dynamic state selection as an approach to peripheral simulation. We will give a detailed insight into the problems usually encountered with low-level emulation and show it's workings with a live demo, which will hopefully inspire you to use it the next time you want to emulate some BIOS logic for exotic hardware or find where that weird driver quirk comes from.",

          "description": "Arm64EC (\"Emulation Compatible\") is Microsoft's latest answer to emulating x86_64 on arm64, allowing code from both architectures to coexist in a single address space, so that an application can be incrementally ported from x86_64 to arm64. I'll cover what Arm64EC is, postulate on why it is the way it is, and lessons learnt from porting LuaJIT to it. What if there was a CPU (and associated C toolchain) capable of executing both x86_64 and arm64 instructions, cheaply switching back and forth at any function call boundary? While there isn't such a thing, Arm64EC emulates such a CPU - any x86_64 code is emulated, and any arm64 code needs to contort itself slightly to allow cheap switching in to and out of the emulator. The result is something of an emulation Frankenstein, but just maybe it'll help adoption of Windows on arm64. Speaking about a Windows feature at an open source event might seem initially odd, but things can be intellectually interesting regardless of origin, and open source tooling such as Wine and LLVM have started to add some support for it, and open source developers might want to port their applications to it (as I have done for LuaJIT).

          "title": "Enhancing OCPP with E2E-Security and Binary Data Streams for a more Secure Energy Ecosystem",
          "description": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of electric vehicle charging, the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) has emerged as a crucial industry standard for communication between charging stations and a central management system. In my presentation I will introduce groundbreaking extensions to OCPP, focusing on the integration of end-to-end digital signatures and binary data streams, a leap forward in efficiency and security within the EV charging ecosystem. The integration of binary data streams via HTTP Web Sockets into OCPP marks a significant enhancement in data transmission efficiency. This approach not only reduces latency and bandwidth usage for large data transfers, but also paves the way for more secure, in-band data transmissions like firmware updates or log file transport. Traditionally, such data transfers required separate HTTP or FTP servers, introducing unnecessary complexity and potential network security risks. With these extensions firmware updates become seamless and more secure, directly within the OCPP framework. Furthermore, the addition of digital signatures to OCPP commands and data structures, such as charging tariffs or grid related commands for controllable consumers according to the German §14a EnWG, introduce a new layer of security and integrity. These signatures ensure that data is not tampered with during transmission - even beyond the traditional scope of OCPP - providing a verifiable trust mechanism in end-to-end EV charging communications and might in the future lead to more cost-efficient intelligent measuring systems. A notable advancement is the use of digital signatures for creating distinct user roles within OCPP. Until now, OCPP lacked the capability to differentiate between user access levels, such as \"normal\" users and \"admin\" users. The introduction of role-based access control, underpinned by digital signatures, allows for precise management of user permissions, enhancing both security and operational efficiency especially in more complex managed charging locations. In my talk, I will delve into the technical implementation details of these extensions. Attendees will gain insights into the practical applications and benefits of these enhancements in the context of the Open Source energy ecosystem. The presentation will also explore the potential future implications and developments that these extensions could usher in, setting the stage for a more secure, efficient, and scalable EV charging infrastructure.",

          "description": "The open source OCPP 2.0.1 CSMS project CitrineOS was initiated by S44. By leveraging over a decade of experience in EV charging software, at S44 we are actively working towards making EV charging more attainable and equitable. In our quest for a greener future, we face a pivotal challenge: by 2030 50% of new U.S. cars will be EVs, but today 28% of chargers in leading cities don't work. Developers must build innovative software to improve and grow the charging network so EV owners can travel with confidence. By creating an open source charge station management system, CitrineOS's goal is to provide the fuel for this change. The project is NEVI compliant, globally available and open to all. CitrineOS is meant to offer a community driven, reliable CSMS that builds a foundation for market participants to innovate on top of a protocol implementation instead of re-inventing the same wheel. The project drives forward the adoption of the OCPP 2.0.1 protocol resulting in more reliable charging networks worldwide. Our hope is that anyone looking to bootstrap a modern charging network, or upgrade an existing one from OCPP 1.6 to OCPP 2.0.1, will consider CitrineOS as their starting point, and that increased community involvement will continue to improve the charging experience delivered by this open source project.

          "description": "The electricity grid faces challenges such as rising electricity demand and the integration of solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, etc. Moreover, smart technologies are being added, providing a wealth of data. The industries associated with these challenges must perform complex calculations to assess the present and future state of the grid. The vast scale and diverse applications demand faster calculations that are cross-platform compatible. Power Grid Model is an open-source library with a C++ core and a well-defined Python API. It conducts state estimation, power flow, and short-circuit calculations for symmetric/asymmetric grids. The library is actively employed in 10+ applications within Alliander. Other major grid operators in the Netherlands, as well as researchers and stakeholders throughout the grid technology chain, use the library to conduct academic, technical, and feasibility studies. In this presentation, we will explore the power-grid-model library, its capabilities, active and future use cases.

          "description": "During these last two decades, transmission system operators (TSOs) have been facing profound changes such as penetration of renewables, DC networks, redefinition of European market mechanisms leading to major evolutions in the way to operate the electrical transmission grids. The goal of carbon neutrality implies that most of the challenges for TSOs are still to come. All those changes imply drastic changes in the way to perform grid analysis and have appropriate computation modules to perform efficient security assessment. Legacy tools are evolving slowly with low information about used approximations. RTE, the French TSO, believes that Open Source is the perfect answer to build power system tools in an efficient, flexible, transparent, and collaborative way. RTE has significantly invested in these Open Source tools and would like to share his experience with demo of tools currently in operation based on PowSyBl framework.",

          "description": "The energy transition poses new challenges to all parties in the energy sector. For grid operators, the rise in renewable energy and electrification of energy consumption leads to the capacity of the grid to near its physical constraints. Forecasting the load on the grid in the next hours to days is essential for anticipating on local congestion and making the most of existing assets. OpenSTEF provides a complete software stack which forecasts the load on the electricity grid for the next hours to days. Given a timeseries of measured (net) load or generation, a fully automated machine learning pipeline is executed which delivers a probabilistic forecast of future load. During this presentation, the implementation of OpenSTEF to fully automatically forecast the load on the grid at the Dutch Distributed System Operator will be shown. Furthermore, the community built around OpenSTEF will be discussed. Take a look at the OpenSTEF website and Github.",

In this talk, we want to focus on the \"developer-friendly\" part, and demonstrate the steps it takes to turn FlexMeasures into a smart backend, for instance to power the intelligent scheduling in your new climate tech startup! (you can also tinker with this at home, of course) In this highly relevant example, we assume you control the heating for your customers' buildings. There is a heat pump and solar panels. You promise your customers to heat their home with their own solar power if possible. You even promise to use the cheapest grid power when the sun isn't shining. Green building, low energy bill! Our tutorial will turn this promise into reality ― in any case, the data-driven optimal computations you'd need (measuring and on/off control of hardware not included). FlexMeasures is a Flask web server, so this tutorial will use Python. We will use the FlexMeasures API, but also its CLI and the Python client ― the possibilities are rich. We also show how to add custom logic in a FlexMeasures plugin. In short, we will: We hope to see you there, and that some of you get inspired to put some climate tech into the field!",

While this is a positive development, it is creating new challenges for grid operators who must facilitate this rapid change on their existing electricity grids. Grid operators try to maximize the utility of the current grid, using flexibility of electricity production and consumption. Shapeshifter is an open source protocol that enables the fastest, fairest, and lowest cost route to a smart energy future by delivering one common approach to efficiently connect smart energy projects and technologies. Shapeshifter implements the Universal Smart Energy Framework for flexibility forecasting, offering, ordering, and settlement processes. Additionally, Shapeshifter enables trading via DSO/TSO coordination platforms that support the protocol. Shapeshifter focuses on the exchange of flexibility between aggregators and distribution and transmission system operators. It describes the corresponding market interactions between them to resolve grid constraints by applying congestion management or grid capacity management. In the presentation, we will introduce Shapeshifter and show the most recent applications of the protocol.",

          "description": "The world has made great progress in providing everyone with access to energy; however, recently, the number of unelectrified people on Earth has increased. Providing access to energy is a critical and complex challenge as most unelectrified people live in extremely remote and hard-to-reach areas, often having limited mobile network connectivity, unknown (future) demand patterns, and extreme weather conditions combined with very low purchasing power of the affected population. The power of Open Source is still completely underrepresented in technological innovations in this sector. We are working towards improving this situation and will showcase one of our flagship examples: An Open Source Battery Management System (BMS) specifically developed for off-grid energy application. Energy storage and its related technologies are key to any off-grid energy application and the Libre Solar BMS has been specially developed for this use case. We will deep dive into the design decisions and features, covering hardware, firmware and an app. The BMS was developed leveraging solely open source tools: The PCB is designed in KiCad, the firmware runs on Zephyr RTOS and the communication interfaces use the ThingSet protocol over various lower layers like Serial, CAN, WebSocket or MQTT. The hardware went through three design iterations and has been lab and field-tested by several organizations. We will conclude and show why this kind of Open Source technology is of such great importance to bring power to the people in both the sense of bringing electricity literally and also creating the grounds for local value creation in the affected geographies. We invite the whole Energy Open Source community to contribute with their efforts to where the contributions can be most impactful on various levels. The Open Source BMS is one great piece, but we need much more of those.",

          "description": "Operating the electrical grid must comply with many constraints on its physical elements. To ensure grid security, TSOs (transmission system operators) have ways of relieving these grid constraints, commonly called \"remedial actions\". These actions may or may not be costly. The EU electricity grid is highly meshed, spanning upon multiple countries and TSOs. National grids are no longer independent: every event can have a spill-over effect across the whole continent. Two of the most important consequences are: - TSOs can \"pollute\" other TSOs' grids with unnecessary electrical flows, putting a strain on their national grids; - Optimizing the cost of grid operation (i.e. of remedial action implementation) is no longer a national problem, but a global one. Thus, it becomes necessary to optimize the operation of the EU grid on a large scale and implement an agreed method to share its costs. Developing open-source tools to achieve these goals has benefits with robustness, transparency, auditability, and re-usability.",

          "description": "Solar energy is predicted to be the largest form of power generation globally by 2040 and having accurate real-time forecasts is critical to anticipating power production. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energies are unpredictable in terms of power generation from one hour to the next. In order to balance the grid, operators need an accurate daily estimate of when and how much PV and other renewable energies will be generated. Open Climate Fix (OCF) is an open-source (OS) AI company using machine learning (ML) to respond to the need for accurate renewable energy forecasts. Connecting energy industry practitioners with ML researchers doing cutting-edge modelling is our aim, and one way we seek to do this is by making much of our code open-source (https://github.com/openclimatefix). In the energy space, OCF’s first focus is on solar nowcasting (short-term forecasting). Our main deep learning model takes in real-time PV data, numeric weather predictions, satellite images, as well as regional grid data, and outputs probabilistic solar electricity nowcasts for solar production systems in the UK. What makes our approach unique is teaching cloud dynamics to the model using satellite data. Our 36-hour forecast, Quartz Solar, is currently used by National Grid, the UK grid operator, as a decision-making tool in their control room. Building on this forecast, we are working on a new open-source model, Quartz Solar OS, that we want everyone (maybe FOSDEM attendees!), not just grid operators, to be able to use. The talk OCF proposes will present the ML techniques used to develop Quartz Solar OS and the possible use cases and climate impact such a forecast could have. And yes, we’re hoping to have a demo!",

          "description": "The energy transition implies making decisions under deep uncertainties. Modelling is known to be effective in providing the evidence needed to shape the transformation of the energy sector in the most cost-effective way. Open source is a known approach to increase accessibility of the energy modelling tools. That led to a rapid increase in a number of available energy models whose development is mainly driven by the academic community. However, developments have focused on a few world regions, where awareness of climate change is high. There is still a coverage gap, especially for countries where the energy sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuels. PyPSA meets Earth initiative aims to address this gap by building a global community focused on developing an ecosystem of Pythonic tools, including the modelling framework PyPSA-Earth. The framework may be utilised to build a ready-to-use regional power system model by extracting all the required data in a workflow orchestrated by Snakemake. A community approach enables the participation of regional experts in the development and brings modelling closer to real-life applications. One of the issues found along this route was the lack of ready-to-use tools to integrate the effects of climate change into power system models. A climate development track in PyPSA-Earth addresses this task and aims to implement approaches to account for changes of climate inputs in a physically correct, yet computationally feasible way. To deal with the regional features of national power systems in a systematic way, a country-wise functionality testing has been carried out. As a result, PyPSA-Earth has been adjusted to be fully capable of building a power system model for any country in the world by a single line of code. The presentation will give an overview of the challenges encountered along this way and guide trough the use cases of PyPSA-Earth to tackle the challenges of the energy transition around the globe.",

          "description": "In this presentation we introduce the Green Timeline Project, an innovative open-source software for evaluating resource usage in ICT systems over time. Addressing the significant energy consumption of modern software, our tool offers continuous measurement capabilities, akin to a CI/CD pipeline. We highlight the increasing resource usage in software development over time, with an emphasis on understanding the environmental impact of new features. Our tool not only tracks usage but also provides in-depth analysis and a badge system for monitoring. We'll demonstrate tool integration into development workflows and discuss its role in the broader context of software lifecycle assessment, underscoring the importance of sustainability in tech. Contemporary Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems are significant energy consumers, with studies indicating they account for 2-5% of global CO2 emissions. At Green Coding Berlin, our focus is on the development of free (as in beer) open-source, freely accessible software that evaluates the resource utilization of both software and hardware. Our flagship, the Green Metrics Tool, is a cutting-edge, industry-standard tool that prioritizes the assessment of resource usage. Traditional methods of measuring software provide only a momentary glimpse and fail to capture the evolving nature of software development. Our presentation will unveil our continuous software measurement tools, designed to track and analyze resource usage over time. We've observed a consistent increase in resource usage across various software products. For instance, a comparison of an email client from two decades ago with its modern counterparts shows a disproportionate increase in resource impact, despite similar functionalities. Our solution, resembling a CI/CD pipeline, continuously tracks the resource impact of open-source software, including Django, Django-Bakery, curl, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL, allowing for temporal comparisons. This method enables the identification of significant changes in resource consumption. The core aim of our project is to enhance awareness and prove that new software features inevitably escalate environmental impact, a factor that should be integrated into development planning. We offer a comprehensive analysis framework and a versatile badge and monitoring system applicable to all software types. This system allows both users and developers to delve into detailed measurements and understand the impact of various features. In our session, we will illustrate the straightforward process of setting up and integrating these tools into everyday development workflows, empowering participants to gauge the environmental footprint of their software. Our discussion will culminate in an exploration of how these practices fit into the larger scope of software lifecycle assessment, emphasizing the importance of sustainability in software development.",

          "description": "Functioning power management is important for the entire spectrum of systems, from embedded to server systems. However, the presentation is specifically aimed at analyzing the Linux software stack - inclusive kernel - of embedded products. It shows how embedded Arm64 systems differ from Intel/AMD systems and what impact this has on the power management software design. The presentation gives concrete insights on how to identify wakeups, the impact of scaling governors and many other subsystems of the kernel. The talk is intermixed by numerous practical examples, which should enable the listener to autonomously analyze and optimize the power consumption for complex embedded systems. The talk has no prerequisites for the audience. Topics such as scheduling or CPU frequency governors are introduced in the talk. Of course, the listener should have a basic understanding of a Linux system and at least a basic understanding of concepts such as processes and interrupts. Even if the talk focuses on an embedded system, the knowledge provided can, with a few exceptions, also be transferred to a server system. So there is no reason for amd64 people to be left out! In addition, a new power management kernel analyzer tool will be introduced and its use, which is not yet available in the kernel upstream tree. Further, discussions about a more flexible, eBPF based CPUIdle governor and other research topics are introduced and can be discussed.",

Emulation tools simulate user actions on a computer and can be used for a variety of tasks, including testing software and automating repetitive tasks. Using emulation tools such as xdotool, actiona, and KDE Eco Tester, I will demonstrate how to automate the creation of usage scenarios, as well as share my experience working on preparing KDE applications Kate and Gcompris for Blue Angel Eco Certification. You will learn how these tools can help you save time and effort, and ensure that your software meets eco-friendliness and quality standards. While emulation tools can be incredibly helpful, they also have their drawbacks. They may not always accurately simulate real-world scenarios and can be complex to set up and use. However, with the right approach, they can be a valuable asset for developers, testers, and anyone interested in sustainable and energy-efficient software. I will provide solutions to these challenges based on my experience working with these tools.",

          "description": "Why is digitalization becoming one of the main assets for wind power energy? Wind farms today boast higher capacity factors, indicating that they are producing more energy relative to their installed capacity. Improved design, coupled with advancements in predictive analytics and control systems, have optimized the performance of wind turbines, making them more reliable and productive. The interest in renewable energy and, particularly, in wind power accelerated dramatically as the war in Ukraine took place. For the first time in history the investment in renewables was the primary response to an energy crisis. The increase in wind power capacity involves some new challenges. Older wind turbines are more prone to failure due to aging and at the same time this must be predicted as accurately as possible for the newer ones, based on data collected in real-time in the field. Predictive maintenance can save a lot of time and money by having the right number of spare parts in stock in the right location. Applying DevOps principles to Big Data predictive analytics can help optimize the use of resources and workflows. This produces major improvements to the spare part recommendation based on IoT data. This presentation illustrates how DevOps practices and related Open-Source tools help build an efficient software infrastructure where wind turbines lifetime predictions and spare part stock recommendations are delivered regularly to service engineers.",

          "description": "The energy transition is causing major issues on our local network infrastructure as well as individual households to become self sufficient. A know problem for everybody attending. However a practical combined approach is new... In this talk we will be presenting several operational use cases, addressing the combined energy optimisation at household level and maximum self consumption within a district or microgrid (to prevent local congestion). Moreover, we are addressing ways how two worlds, can meet in the middle: the one at grid level with DSO's, system integrators and large (industrial, commercial) users) with the one at the home level (consumers, energy providers, consumer products). In addition we like to share and discuss how the merging of two traditionally separate domains (heating and electricity) will impact optimisation. We will present and show (live demos) the following operational use cases, fully build on open source: - Nottingham City Council - Microgrid optimisation at Eastcroft depot, with V2G, solar, storage, and agile tariffs - Amsterdam Sporenburg - Preventing network congestion involving 500 households, as well as controlling (public) charging infrastructure; preparing for energy sharing - Athens - Energy cooperation with shared solar plant, optimising self consumption with the community members smart homes",

          "description": "As developers, we write unit tests in a TDD-style workflow for validating the behavior of our applications and libraries. However, all possible situations need to be manually thought out when writing the tests for the code. Property based testing aims to solve this by allowing the developer to specify behavior of their programs in terms of properties (invariants) of their code and then automatically generating tests that check if the property is indeed valid. In this talk, the key concepts of property based testing will be explained, along with clarifying examples, ranging from introductory snippets to more complex ‘real life’ scenarios. The examples will be written in Elixir; a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. The high level, flexible and expressive nature of the language make it an ideal fit for declaring properties against which a program can be checked.",

With the development of a type system for Elixir, multiple explorations for Erlang, and the steady growth of Gleam there is increasing demand for practical discussions on how types can be used to write better programs. This talk explores one such technique, known as \"phantom types\". We will learn what phantom types are, why they can be useful, and see some examples of Gleam packages employing them in the wild to achieve safer APIs.",

Building on state machines as a model to reimplement technical debt, we will traverse the intersection of gen_statem practical implementation and the theoretical foundations of state machines. Using real-world application examples, we will go over from the industry beast to the theoretical abyss, revealing the mathematical elegance inherent in state machines and its more powerful automata siblings. Bridging this gap, we will empower Erlang developers to architect solutions that go beyond conventional patterns, with concrete examples and plenty of code to read, providing the attendees with a comprehensive vision to harness the full potential of gen_statem.",

The model is a state-description and has to be well-defined, because of this we manage it with the type-safety of Gleam. The instances each contain an independent state. We want to migrate this state when the state description changes. Because of this, we generate the code for the instances in Core Erlang, and use BEAM facilities to upgrade the instances while running.

When confronted with an unusual error, we might search for it in the code, which often gives multiple results, so we resort to guessing. We might also decide to trace with tools like dbg or recon, but here we need to guess, which functions to trace. I would like to show you a different approach, where the first step is to trace multiple modules or even whole apps. Then you can query, analyse, process and even execute the collected traces. The tool itself is so simple, that you will be able to use it instantly. It is also battle-proven, as I have used it numerous times to debug the MongooseIM project, which I am leading. Limit unnecessary guesswork and have more time for creative work.",

Although it's goal is to enable and inspire youth (10+), curious makers of all ages are encouraged to embrace the joys of physical computing. Unlike other programming environments for microcontrollers, MicroBlocks is LIVE. That is, the MicroBlocks IDE (editor running on a computer) and the MicroBlocks code (running on a microcontroller) are constantly kept in sync. The blocks-based editor makes it easy to click any block or script of blocks to execute them immediately. Development and debugging occur at the same time. The project lives up to its tagline \"small, fast, human friendly\". :)",

As modifying the bootloader is out of the question, we can at least replace the environment it gives us with a more sensible one. In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to what an EFI bootloader actually is, how they work, and how U-Boot fits into the picture as a second-stage bootloader. I'll cover the work I've been doing to improve Qualcomm support in upstream U-Boot, and how we can drastically lower the barrier of entry for distro support on Qualcomm phones. Lastly, I'll go over the new process for porting a Qualcomm SoC to U-Boot, and demo booting Linux with EFI runtime support on a Qualcomm phone.",

          "description": "Yes, and we’re in pretty good shape! For the last 10 years, Qualcomm’s engineers and Linaro’s Qualcomm Landing Team has been working hard to carefully implement Linux mainline support for Qualcomm platforms, and so far so good it’s pretty good now as you can judge with the very good Thinkpad X13S support. Neil will do a tour of all supported platforms, describe the work the Linaro’s Qualcomm Landing Team has achieved so far and the key features engineers are working on. The Qualcomm SoCs are notoriously very complex and very powerful, and implementing clean, correct, maintainable and extensible support for mainline Linux is particularly hard. Key domains like Power or DSP management were particularly hard to support, with those in good shape multimedia, connectivity and network features getting enabled permitting Qualcomm based devices to offer excellent support while running vanilla (unmodified) Linux kernel ! The Thinkpad X13S is a great example of such support, because until recently it was limited to expensive and hard to buy Qualcomm Reference platforms. Nevertheless the Qualcomm Reference platforms also get as early as possible mainline support, without any concessions on code quality, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mailing-list patches delivered on marketing announcement day. The talk will propose a tour of supported platforms, current and possible future achievements, and integration examples with mobile distributions like PostmarketOS.",

          "description": "Marius has been playing around with VoLTE with Qualcomm Mediatek devices. He has got to the point of being able to make and receive calls and send and receive SMSs on Ubuntu Touch ported devices. It is still very hacky. Without any knowledge of the modem stack it seemed impossibly difficult, but now we are getting some insights into how it works it is possible to see how the binary blobs are doing stuff. The way forward was to run Android and capture all the calls made to the drivers. Sailfish have some of it working, so their solution provided tools too. The fixes so far are very specific, every proprietary system has its own unique way of doing things. It is a horrible standard, and no carrier even follows the standard. The modem is a black box with no outputs. To be honest, when it works, we don’t know why it works. It works perfectly well, though, so result. He would like to share his results, to discuss with the wider community how we can roll this out to get more devices supported. In the recent and coming years 2G and 3G are being phased out by network operators, especially on a lot of Mobile Foss OSes that are Halium based. This means that they will be useless because you can't make calls any more. It has been extremely difficult to enable VoLTE service due to all the proprietary components. VoLTE stands for Voice over LTE, and LTE (Long Term Evolution) is better known as 4G. So essentially, VoLTE amounts to mobile calls over a 4G network.",

Basic 5G support is already available in current versions of ModemManager, although there are key differences with earlier technologies like 3G or 4G that should be considered, e.g. with respect to network attach settings or multiple/concurrent access technology support. Advanced 5G features, like 5G network slicing support, are not yet supported in ModemManager. These are in the roadmap for future releases, and open for discussion with the community on how to best implement them. This talk covers past, present and future of the 5G technology support in ModemManager. How we have reached its current state, what technical debt we carry, and how the future implementation may look like.",

          "description": "Since the introduction of Genode for the PinePhone at this developer room one year ago, this alternative mobile OS has matured to the point of real-world usability for a group of pilot users. In this talk, Genode developer Norman Feske is going to share the experiences made along the way, reiterate the many advances, demonstrate the current version, and ask: What should come next? Genode on the PinePhone realizes a new vision of a smartphone OS designed from the ground up for user autonomy. Following the announcement of the very first version at the FOSS-on-Mobile developer room in 2023, the system got into the hands of a group of pilot users. The talk will share this experience and highlight the key points we met towards our goal of real-world usability. First, we found it important to attain a tight feedback loop between testers and us developers, which prompted us to create a system-update mechanism that allows for instantly updating the system, or rolling it back to any previous version. Now, a new version can reach the hands of testers in a matter of seconds. With the quick way of testing new versions in place, the feedback we got regarding our attempts at implementing energy-saving measures - in particular screen blanking - was quite instructive to attain a refined solution. At a technical level, the solution is interesting as it combines a Forth-based custom power-management firmware with Genode's microkernel-based architecture. Don't worry, the talk will only briefly touch those eccentricities. With the power drain reduced to a practical level, we turned our attention to the application level. The talk will briefly introduce our SDK named Goa, which streamlines the development to the point where almost unmodified Qt/QML-based applications can be targeted at the Genode-based phone. To stress the latter point, we made the Linphone VoIP stack available on this system. The talk will be garnished by practical demonstrations. Besides being thrilled to present the current state, I'm eager to gather feedback from the community about the most worthwhile directions for the next year.",

Even after spending many hours recompiling the entire system or patching it, there's no guarantee of achieving satisfactory results. Linux allows us to do incredible things, encouraging experimentation, play, and learning. As a Mesa3D developer, I have chosen to share my journey of running an LLM model using OpenCL as an example.",

          "description": "This talk delves into the evolution of Ubuntu Touch on PINE64 devices since its release in 2020. Over the past several years there have been significant changes, both to the development team and the codebase. The shifts in the UBPorts/PINE64 community stem from the original PinePhone port’s maintainer moving on from the project, which coincided with the release of the PinePhone Pro. This left the community at a crossroads: necessitating the search for a new maintainer and the development of a new port. A key milestone in this journey was the showcasing of an early-stage community port for the PinePhone Pro running on Ubuntu Touch 20.04 at FOSDEM last year. Since then, a new maintainer has achieved remarkable improvements, including porting 20.04 to the original PinePhone and PineTab, as well as the newly released PineTab2. This presentation will explore the challenges encountered in integrating new devices, updating existing ones, and the process of harmonizing mainline Linux with Ubuntu Touch. This is particularly crucial as Ubuntu Touch has historically leaned towards devices designed for Android/Halium-based devices, somewhat sidelining mainline Linux in the transition to 20.04. Furthermore, the discussion will extend to the future prospects of this port and its implications for Lomiri on mainline Linux across different distributions.",

          "description": "The Gecko rendering engine is used in many weird and wonderful places. For over a decade it has been the stock rendering engine for the default browser on Sailfish OS, a Linux-based mobile operating system for use on mobile phones and tablets. The browser implementation was originally developed around the EmbedLite/xulrunner API, which is no longer officially supported. This provides interesting challenges for keeping the browser up-to-date with the latest Gecko changes. For the last 92 days (maybe more depending on when you're reading this) I've been daily-blogging about my experiences upgrading the ESR 78 Gecko rendering engine used on Sailfish OS to ESR 91. Once ESR 91 is complete the plan is to move to ESR 102 and beyond. Eventually we hope to reach a stable rhythm alongside the official Gecko releases. This has been a communal effort, with other members of the Sailfish OS community helping with the development, from submitting changes to tooling to creating AI-generated images to liven up the blog posts. Many users from the community are now involved all with the singular aim of getting our Gecko upgraded. The breadth of technologies involved (Rust, C++, JavaScript, Python) makes it a fascinating project to work with and write about. We've learnt a lot about the Gecko codebase in the process as well as the challenges in deploying Gecko to unusual mobile and embedded platforms. Our hope is that once we reach the latest version, we'll be able to look into contributing more changes upstream to help maintain our Gecko deployment more easily in the future. We'd love to discuss the best way to achieve this. In this talk I'll share my experiences of working with Gecko in an open way and in collaboration with the community, before opening it out to a discussion about how best to work with upstream.

I worked at the Advanced Processor Technologies (APT) group of the University of Manchester where I led the development of the Maxine VM, a metacircular Java-in-Java VM. Before that I worked at the Computer Architecture and VLSI Systems Laboratory (CARV) of FORTH-ICS, where in the context of the GreenVM project, I developed DiSquawk, a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that targets non-cache-coherent architectures. During my post-graduate studies I also developed SCOOP, a source-to-source compiler that used information from task annotations (memory footprints) to generate optimized code for task-based runtime systems. I was also involved in the development and performance analysis process of the TPC (Tagged Procedure Calls), BDDT (Block-level Dynamic Dependence Analysis for Deterministic Task-Based Parallelism) and PARTEE (PARallel Task Execution Engine) task-based runtime systems."

JFR has been re-implemented in Native Image so that it can be included with executables and behave with a similar experience to JFR in OpenJDK. In this presentation, we'll peel back the layers and give you a tour of some of the most vital parts of JFR's inner workings in Native Image. At various points, we'll stop and draw comparisons to how JFR is implemented in OpenJDK. From this presentation, listeners will get exposure to some of the unique challenges to developing low-level implementations for Java-on-Java and ahead-of-time compiled applications. They will also gain a better understanding of how key JFR components work under-the-hood.",

          "description": "The Java platform has always provided a rich set of libraries to allow developers to reach beyond the boundaries of the JVM, from databases (JDBC) to web services (HTTP client). Unfortunately, accessing foreign memory (i.e. memory not managed by the JVM) and invoking foreign functions (i.e. code outside the JVM) in Java is still significantly harder than it should be. The Foreign Function & Memory Access API (FFM API in short) is a new API in Java SE 22 which aims at reducing the impedance mismatch between Java applications and native libraries in three steps. First, the FFM API provides a rich API to model a region of off-heap memory as a memory segment. The contents of memory segments can be described using memory layouts, and accessed using var handles. Moreover, the lifetime of memory segments is managed explicitly, and safely, thus reducing the risk of use-after-free bugs. Second, the FFM API provides a rich API to describe and link native functions. Once linked, such functions can then be invoked, using method handles. The dual - turning Java methods into function pointers - is also possible, thus achieving full bi-directional interoperability between Java and native code. Third, thanks to the compositional nature of the FFM API, access to native libraries can be simplified even further with the use of a tool (jextract) which mechanically generates the FFM API artifacts needed to access said libraries. Designing a complex API such as the FFM API poses some unique design and implementation challenges: how does a Java program reason about the lifetime of a region of memory outside the boundaries of the Java heap? How can it describe the signature of foreign functions? And, what new risks does the FFM API pose to the integrity of the Java platform as a whole? Resolving such challenges requires a careful balancing act, where access to low-level features is realized in ways that are consistent with the evolution and the core principles of the Java platform.",

          "description": "The Fuzion language is a hybrid functional and object-oriented language that in many respects behaves exactly diametrical to Java. Nevertheless, the JVM has turned out an excellent target platform for Fuzion and in this talk I will present why that is the case and what challenges had to be overcome. Fuzion uses algebraic types, i.e., product types and tagged union types. All types can be parametric, but unlike Java not using type-erasure but monomorphisation. Unlike Java, where user defined types have reference semantics, Fuzion has value semantics by default, reference semantics only for types that are explicitly declared so. I will present how these are implemented in the new JVM byte-code back-end and what trade-offs and optimizations are made. In particular, I will present several levels of optimizations for tagged union types when mapped to efficient to byte-code show how product type with value semantics are implemented, where the JIT compiler creates surprisingly efficient code and how we all could profit form project valhalla explain how type parameters (generics) are implemented using monomorphisation including support for basic types as type parameters and what benefits this brings. analyze the JVM's black magic of method dispatch and its impact on implementing dynamic dispatch for multiple inheritance in Fuzion. show how the classfile verifier helped to fix bugs in the C backend Links: - github: https://github.com/tokiwa-software/fuzion - Fuzion portal: https://flang.dev",

They serialize a warmed-up Java application to disk and allow users to quickly resume their application from that specific state at a later point in time. The smaller the serialized JVM/application image is, the faster it can be restored or transferred to a remote location. This talk is about minimizing the memory footprint of the JVM before a snapshot/checkpoint. Uncommitting unused parts of the address space works well for CRIU but imposes challenges for full KVM snapshots because of the \"semantic gap\" between the guest and host operating system. We will demonstrate how zeroing and kernel features like init_on_free, Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) and ballooning can improve the snapshot/restore process and will compare CRIU and Firecracker snapshot sizes.",

By combining Java's module technology with OpenShift (Enterprise Kubernetes by Red Hat) we can produce bespoke containers, with just the necessary OpenJDK modules for the application, in some cases shaving off half of the on-disk image size. OpenShift's unique features enable us to configure a multi-stage pipeline, automatically triggered updated application source, base image or custom events of a user's choice, producing a corresponding lean runtime image ready for deployment. In this talk we'll outline our approach integrating these technologies, explain some of the challenges and report on the results that can be achieved.",

          "description": "The JVM vs. WebAssembly: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis This session contrasts, in extreme detail, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and WebAssembly (Wasm), two platforms that have reshaped the landscape of software development. While their basic architecture of a \"virtual machine\" draws parallels, their design, intentions, bytecode formats, and future directions reveal considerable differences. Differences in Intent and Bytecode Adaptations We'll examine the underlying intentions behind the creation of the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM was initially designed to support the Java language, it has since accommodated other languages like Scala, Groovy, and Kotlin, and has been provided with implementations for dynamic languages like Ruby and Python. WebAssembly, on the other hand, was designed from the outset to support multiple languages, aiming to serve as a compact binary format for the web. We'll analyze how these intentions have influenced the way other languages have been adapted to their respective bytecode formats, by carefully examining the pain points found in JVM and Wasm implementations across the same source languages Bytecode Differences, Implementation, and Control Flow Here we will delve into the technical details of each platform's bytecode. While the JVM uses stack-based bytecode, WebAssembly uses a structured stack machine model. The implications of these different approaches will be discussed, with particular attention to aspects like performance, security, and portability. We'll also explore their respective implementations and control flow mechanisms through the use of detailed code examples, as well as high-level expositions. Standardization Processes, Stakeholders, and Incentives An important part of this talk will focus on the standardization processes of both the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM’s specification is controlled by Oracle, with community input through the Java Community Process (JCP), WebAssembly is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). We'll discuss the various stakeholders involved in each process and explore the incentives that drive the evolution of these systems. The Future of WebAssembly We'll discuss the future direction of WebAssembly, touching on upcoming proposals such as garbage collection, and the Component Model. Additionally, we'll look at the development of runtimes like Wasmtime, the WebAssembly Micro-Runtime (WAMR), and GraalWasm, and discuss how these work to extend the reach of WebAssembly in new and interesting ways JVM and the Universal Compilation Target In our closing discussion, we'll tackle the common assertion that WebAssembly is \"just the JVM again\", and explore why the JVM didn’t quite become the universal compilation target it was often touted years ago. Factors such as the JVM's resource usage, security issues, specific design details have all played a part, and we'll discuss how and what WebAssembly has learned from these challenges. This session's ultimate goal is to give attendees a detailed understanding of the JVM and WebAssembly, enabling more informed decisions in software development and a clearer perspective on the futures of these two technologies.",

          "description": "A Java thread in the JVM regularly checks whether it should do extra work besides the execution of the bytecode. This work is done during so-called safepoints. There are two types of safepoints: local and global. This allows the JVM to do activities like method deoptimizations or stop-the-world garbage collections, where the amount of concurrency should be limited. But how do they actually work?

          "description": "This summer, I worked with my mentor Jan Hubicka and Martin Jambor on a project to bypass assembler when generating LTO object files. Here is a brief insight into my project: Link Time Optimization (LTO) enables GCC to dump its internal representation (GIMPLE) to disk so that a single executable can be optimized as a single module. The current implementation creates an assembly file, and the assembler creates the final LTO object file from the provided binary contents. This project aims to create Link-time-optimization (LTO) object files directly from the compiler to improve compile time performance significantly by bypassing the assembler. The GCC's LTO infrastructure has matured enough to compile large real-world applications. Thus, this project will significantly reduce their compile time once completed. - More detail: https://github.com/rsh-raj/gcc-gsoc-submission/tree/main In this presentation, I will discuss the current state of my project and future direction. Additionally, I will delve into my journey, discussing the challenges I encountered as a beginner working with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and how I overcame them with the community's help.",

To handle Unicode characters efficiently and in a user-friendly way, Rust uses various techniques in parser and mangler. I worked on Unicode support for GCC Rust last summer during Google Summer of Code 2023. At present, GCC Rust adequately handles Unicode characters, although there are still a few tasks left to be completed.

Yet Compiler-Explorer can do much more than simply displaying the assembly: sharing a compilation, using libraries, executing the program, using various tools (on source code or on resulting binaries), visualizing the CFG, accessing its services through an API, etc. For a compiler user, the website is useful to test how a given language construct is compiled, to optimize for size and/or performance, etc. For a compiler developer, the website can be used to share bug reproducer, test if a bug applies to other versions of the compiler, inspect IR dumps, use scripts to automate some tasks, etc. I'm proposing a short presentation focused on how Compiler-Explorer can be used around GCC: compare the results of different compilations, inspect the Tree/RTL dumps, check the result for other compiler versions/arguments, etc. I'm also interested in getting some feedback and/or ideas for new features.",

          "description": "GCC Static Analyzer (SA) is a highly promising tool aiming to enhance the compiler with extensive analysis capabilities, such as through the use of a plugin API. We used it to implement an analysis targeting constant-time vulnerabilities. Most of the existing tools rely on formal methods and remain barely used (see Jancar et al.). This study conclude that compiler-based tools are well-received among cryptographic developers. Our initial tests highlighted that the primary design of the analyzer's inner state machines heavily relies on pointer-related analysis, which leverages alias analysis. However, it was triggering undesirable side effects in our case. The needs for our analysis is to also be able to track state for lvalue, alongside rvalue, depending of the target's type. The subject of this talk is to introduce a practical case where this behavior would allow such analysis to be done, especially since the SA codebase is already heavily prepared for it. A proof-of-concept to give this ability to the SA has been implemented and aims to be merged after feedback from the community on the idea. Problems caused by some aspects of C semantics arise and will be interesting to discuss (e.g., the thin frontier between arrays and pointers). Source code of the project is publicly available here: https://gitlab.inria.fr/pphilipp/gcc-plugin-ct. Prior knowledge for attending: GCC internals and GCC SA basic knowledge, C semantics.",

          "description": "Many GNU Linux distributions start their own bootstrap process with a set of binary seeds. Because, how do you build a modern C/C++ compiler without a C/C++ compiler? To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, an approach taken by some distributions is to rely on opaque, pre-build binaries. However, in order to increase trustworthiness in software, we should be able to produce every part of it from source, or at least reduce the size of the initial binary seed to the absolute minimum. In the bootstrappable builds movement, the GCC version 4.7 plays an important role: it is the last GCC version that can be built with only a C compiler. Therefore, this compiler is a stepping stone for bootstrapping everything that relies on the C++ language and above. Another important metric for trustworthiness is the capability to build reproducibly, independently of the build directory, which we addressed with patches, as it is not a native feature of this compiler version. Furthermore, additional patches were required for bringing this compiler version up to date, i.e., adding support for more recent C libraries (e.g., the musl libc) and for obtaining a compiler installation that works independently of its install prefix. We would like to present a build description (for the JustBuild build system), used to patch and bootstrap a GCC version 4.7 on a minimal x86_64 Linux system, which only needs a POSIX shell, coreutils, and a C library (GNU, musl) installed. To achieve this, the bootstrap process starts by building Busybox, GNU Make, and Binutils from scratch before those are used to bootstrap GCC 4.7. We can furthermore show how that compiler can then be used to bootstrap additional build tools (Make, CMake, Python) and even the most recent compilers (GCC 13.2, Clang 17), all from source on the exact same minimal system. In doing so, we basically bootstrap an extremely minimalistic Linux distribution for building compiler toolchains. All of that is strictly defined within a single JustBuild project, which is publicly available under an open-source license at: https://github.com/just-buildsystem/bootstrappable-toolchain.",

          "description": "One of the greatest strengths of GCC is the sheer volume of architectures which it can target, many of which are niche or legacy platforms. But how has this support translated into real-world utility? How well are some of these platforms still supported? Using the Sega Dreamcast and its SH4 CPU as a case-study, we take a look at just how far GCC is allowing its homebrew community to take the platform, providing modern C23, C++23, Objective-C, D, and even some Rust to the 1990s game console.",

There are a lot of questions that the regular go programmer doesn't need to know and usually doesn't know, but if you, like me, are a curious person, you probably want to know more about what is going on under the hood. Come with me on this interesting trip through one of the most outstanding features of the Go language, the goroutines, and discover what makes your Go programs tick! In this talk we are going to explore how is the life of a goroutine. We are going to start talking about the go runtime scheduler in general, and we are going to talk about the most important structures there, P, M, G and Sched. Once we have that clear we are going to explore how a goroutine is created and after the creation, how it change states, exploring the different states like Waiting, Runnable or Running, but also others. We are going to talk about the transitions between them to finish talking about the death of a goroutine. After this talk you should have an intuition about how your goroutines are scheduled and why they transit from one state to another.",

With this tool and DSL, I'll demo how I built a full, single-binary provisioning solution so that you can use your own laptop to bootstrap an entire infrastructure. Thanks to the go(lang) static compilation, it makes it very easy to have a single binary that includes tftp, dhcp and http servers, it can run a pxe boot and OS kickstart, and it can even rsync a local mirror to run an offline installation from. We'll take you through a tour of all the plumbing that needed to be changed to support this. We'll show lots of real-time demos to keep everyone entertained. I'll talk about the long journey it took to get us here, and how you can get involved.",

          "description": "Testing is a corner stone of modern software engineering: whether you adopt full fledged Test Driven Development (TDD) practices or write tests after you finished your implementation, no serious workplace should tolerate code without tests. Go recognises the importance of tests by including first class support to different test types (unit, benchmark and fuzzy) and metrics (e.g. test coverage). But even with all this tooling, how can we ensure that we are writing good tests? Are we really testing the code or just producing fake test coverage? In order to answer this question, in this talk we are going to explore the concept of mutation tests and how they can be used to validate if the tests that we write are actually working in the way we expect then to. Topics included in this talk: - The concept of mutation tests - Running tests in Go - Compiler overlays - Abstract syntax trees - A simple demo to illustrate the concept",

          "description": "Since its early days (Go 1.2 - 2013), Go has offered great support for code coverage. Recently, the community also introduced the same support for integration tests. This feature gives projects written in Go better visibility about test coverage, resulting in enhanced stability and more. ARMO's experiment consisted of providing the complete test coverage percentage as a metric for generated Seccomp profiles. During the automated tests we hooked the system calls, collecting them into a security profile, by using eBPF. This allowed us to measure the generated profile reliability that was created with the system calls used during this time. Unfortunately, not all the experiments succeed. This talk will give an introduction to the research we did and end what are the limitations that we encountered during our journey.",

This talk will illustrate how you can use code coverage collection in a production system to identify such dead code. We'll explore practical techniques for leveraging Go's coverage tools in a live environment, shedding light on the unseen and unnecessary parts of your codebase.",

          "description": "Building a nice and responsive GUI is no easy task. It is especially difficult when you're working with a small microcontroller and the existing graphics libraries have various limitations. So I set to work to fix that by building my own graphics library for small embedded systems. A year ago I started working on a firmware for the Pine64 PineTime, using TinyGo of course. My goal was to have a usable firmware for the watch, while improving the surrounding TinyGo ecosysteem wherever I could. My end goal is to make developing firmware as simple as writing any desktop application. In this talk I'll describe how I initially added support for the PineTime in TinyGo with some low level hardware details, how low cost displays work, and how I improved the performance of these displays under TinyGo. But I'll also describe how I built a somewhat accurate simulator as part of the hardware abstraction layer, how I implemented a very fast graphics library using generics, and of course how I used all of these to write firmware that can run on the PineTime and any similar smartwatch supported by TinyGo. While this talk may get technical sometimes, I'll make sure it's still easy to follow even if you're not an embedded developer.",

She has been (co-)organizing the Go Devroom since 2018 with a passion of bringing the Go community closer together.\nIn her spare time she's not afraid of electronics, frontend code or managing a stay-at-home Kubernetes cluster while doing crazy stuff. However \"painting cute gophers on my nails\" could probably be described as her typical Saturday evening."

Raspberry Pi 5 has available FLOSS GPU drivers on product launch, exposing OpenGL-ES 3.1 and Vulkan 1.2. We'll go through the changes needed to enable desktop OpenGL 3.1 on RPi4/5. We will also review the changes done to the kernel driver to expose the RPi5 capabilities and the new GPU stats support for RPi4/5.

          "description": "Flutter is an open-source UI Software Development kit created by Google using an Apache license. It is an open-source multi-platform single code base. Used to develop applications from web browsers to OS like Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. It's also in the top ten most popular projects on GitHub. Flutter was first released by Google in 2015 supporting Android devices to render consistently at 120 frames per second and soon later supporting iOS. In 2021 Google released Flutter 2 supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Flutter emerged in the embedded world as an alternative to other UI frameworks like LVGL or Qt. The main advantages are free and open source against commercial license; declarative UI approach against procedural UI approach meaning a more expressive and flexible approach; hot reload and hot restart against rebuild and redeploy making work less time-consuming; large and active open source community. This talk will give an overview of these topics, starting from the integration in the OS build system like Buildroot and Yocto, showing the development environment and the differences between the languages C++/QML and Dart/Flutter with code examples. Finally, I'll quickly show a real industrial custom product developed and shipped with a Flutter UI application, the challenges and the result that we achieved.",

In the world of modern tooling at so many levels it is important that graphical user interface is not left behind - and that is why Fyne was created. As Go's most popular GUI toolkit it has never been easier to build native apps that work on any platform! This talk will look at getting started through building first complete app, and show how it will run on desktop and mobile devices. It will also introduce advanced tooling and low-code options available for the ecosystem to support wider adoption in this exciting area of development.",

It runs under the Linux Framebuffer, under X11 (SDL and now also GDK), or in text terminals (ASCII Art, also coloured), with a consistent interface and with many powerful features. FIM is known among enthusiasts of Raspberry Pi and other minimalistic computing devices, but also among VIM/Emacs users seeking functionality, configurability, and flexibility behind a minimalistic interface styled after VIM and Emacs. This short talk introduces FIM, its philosophy, and how the GTK graphical mode makes it more user-friendly.",

He received his PhD in Italy while working on efficient data structures for multi-threaded sparse matrix computations. Before joining LRZ, he worked at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics as an HPC expert, optimizing and parallelizing simulation codes. In the last years he started using formal methods for source-to-source-transformations for HPC codes with novel uses of the Coccinelle semantic patching system. He is the author of the LIBRSB library, providing an efficient, yet general and portable Sparse BLAS-styled implementation of his PhD research' data structures to C, C++, Fortran, Python and GNU Octave. ( BLAS stands for \"Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines: and is an API specification). His pet project FIM is a universal scriptable image viewer unique in its kind, empowering command line Linux users regardless of the device, be it X, the framebuffer, or an ASCII-Art capable terminal.\nMichele's web presence is on https://michelemartone.github.io/ and https://github.com/michelemartone"

          "description": "For a long time, scientific publications focused only on experimental results, ignoring how, concretely, the results were obtained, making difficult for readers, but also for the author, to reproduce the experiments. Things are slowly changing: publication of so-called \"artifacts\" are encouraged by journals and conferences. However, releasing scripts and programs used for experiments can be challenging: how to organize the material? how to clearly document the instructions? how to ensure reproducibility of the experiments? how to ensure long-term availability? Several answers are possible to all these questions. In this talk, I will try to summarize how and why my methodology to build reproducible artifacts evolved over several years in the research area.",

This tool uses real-time carbon intensity data from the UK's National Grid ESO via their API to estimate the carbon intensity of the electricity grid, and schedules tasks at times when the estimated carbon intensity is lowest. This helps to reduce the carbon emissions associated with running computationally intensive tasks, making it an ideal solution for environmentally conscious developers. Currently CATS is built to work with the simple \"at\" scheduler, but work is underway to port it to Slurm.

          "description": "Scientific applications rely on third-party libraries, which may have multiple implementations with many of these implementations not sharing the application binary interface (ABI) and require recompiling depending on the target system. Recompiling can be a long and complex process, (1) impeding application execution across different HPC and Cloud systems; (2) adding developer hours rebuilding an application; and (3) not taking advantage of host-optimized libraries. The Wi4MPI library, developed at CEA, addresses this ABI incompatibility in MPI. Wi4MPI translates the ABI dynamically from the MPI library used to build the application to a different MPI library available at run time. With Wi4MPI, HPC practitioners can break the portability barrier imposed by ABI incompatibility, potentially increase performance, and increase user productivity. This presentation is broken down in three components: (1) Understanding ABI compatibility in MPI; (2) Translating MPI libraries dynamically; and (3) Applying dynamic translation to key use cases in HPC, including Containers.",

          "description": "The world’s largest supercomputers get most of their potential from their GPU accelerators. As such, it is essential to target GPUs when running on such powerful machines. Given the desire for portability of applications, OpenMP offloading is a popular way to accelerate applications on GPUs. This talk presents the ROCm OpenMP offloading compiler from two perspectives: compiler flags and compiler/runtime implementation. Given that it may be critical to use the right compiler flags, the talk presents some of the tuning knobs that the ROCm OpenMP compiler exposes to users. It will go into more detail of what optimization, feature, and parameter the specific compiler flags enable. For each of the compiler flags listed, the talk will present information on what occurs in the compiler and the runtime library. For several of these switches, the talk presents performance results. In particular, the talk covers the high-level flag -fopenmp-target-fast and what optimizations are enabled by that switch. It will then go into more detail about the specific flags for the selected underlying optimizations and their user-facing parameter options that allow for fine-tuning in certain scenarios. Specifically, the talk covers the following flags: In addition to the compiler flags, the runtime offers additional configurability via environment variables. Some of these variables influence the very same mechanisms, whereas other provide separate mechanisms. The talk gives an overview of some of these variables and how they influence execution.

          "description": "When procuring new hardware for an HPC system, the hardware vendors can be provided with targets to hit. This can either be performance per dollar but more recently also includes metrics like performance per watt. Industry standard benchmarks like Linpack, Stream, or Spec are not necessarily representative for the jobs that will actually run on the system and their predicted performance per dollar or watt might not be accurate when users run their tasks on the system. At the association for national high performance computing (NHR) we are developing a pipeline to generate a representative benchmark collection from an observed job mix to provide to hardware vendors. One essential step is the so called mini-app extraction. A mini-app is a standalone kernel of a given HPC application, making it significantly smaller in terms of lines of code but retaining the computational characteristic of the original application. Based on these mini-apps vendors can better suite there hardware offerings to the expected use. As mini-apps usually need to be crafted manually by domain experts, we are developing Mini-Apex. Mini-Apex is an open source compiler tool based on Clang, able to help extract mini-apps from C and C++ applications. It uses a MetaCG to generate a call-graph with attached analysis results, and PIRA to identify the kernel. It then extract the kernel-function, as well as all necessary sub-routines, variables, classes, structs, and definitions into a mini-app, reusing most of the build system of the original application.",

          "description": "The talk will outline the technical lessons learned in development of the PyPartMC project (https://pypi.org/p/PyPartMC). The key goal of PyPartMC is to provide a maintainable multi-platform pip-installable package enabling interoperability between the Python ecosystem and the internal components of PartMC – an open-source aerosol dynamics simulation package. The wrapped PartMC package (https://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/partmc) has been in active development for almost two decades and is used in computational research ranging from process studies on ice formation in clouds to large-scale simulations of air pollution evolution coupled with weather forecasting models. PartMC has a modular, test-covered, pseudo-OOP, Fortran 90 codebase; several C and Fortran dependencies (SUNDIALS, MPI, netCDF, SuiteSparse, ...); and a bespoke config-file subsystem supporting nested files for variable-size input. Developing PyPartMC, we aim to provide added value to both the existing community of PartMC users, accustomed to the Fortran/HPC ecosystem, as well as to a wider community potentially daunted by the entry threshold pertinent to the multiple steps needed to obtain, compile, setup and run PartMC, and analyse its output. Steps which so far involved usage of diverse tools and languages, and which are meant to be achievable in a single computational research environment such as Python, Julia or Matlab. To this end, PyPartMC is available at pypi.org in form of both source (with all 10+ dependencies in git submodules) as well as binary packages (Linux, Windows and macOS). Binary packages have all the dependencies statically linked, what is orchestrated using CMake via standard wheel-building logic. The design features: (i) employment of unmodified Fortran code of the wrapped PartMC package; (ii) binding logic implemented in C++ using pybind11; (iii) garbage collection of Fortran derived type instances; (iv) a drop-in i/o layer replacement matching the Fortran config-file subsystem API, which C++ sees as nlohmann::json objects, and which quacks like ordinary dicts from Python perspective. On top of that, a thorough test coverage including Github-Actions-hooked checks for interoperability with Matlab's built-in Python bridge and with Julia (using PyCall.jl).

          "description": "In today's fast-paced business environment, and especially with the advent of machine learning (ML), organizations are seeking ways to derive better insights from their data as quickly as possible. However, implementing a complete ML pipeline can be quite challenging. It’s even harder if you want to process newly arrived data immediately or you have a legacy system which is not easy to connect with your modern infrastructure . Change Data Capture (CDC) has emerged as a technology for delivering real-time data changes from various sources, especially from the databases. In this talk we will introduce Debezium, a leading open source framework for CDC. We will discuss how it can be leveraged for ingesting data from the various databases into ML frameworks like TensorFlow and what the pitfalls are if you go this route. Attendees will gain an understanding of how Debezium CDC works, how it can help them to ingest data from the source database into the ML framework in real time and also what are the possible challenges with this approach.",

          "description": "Once a codebase gets large, refactoring for performance is difficult. Challenges include: the sheer time to carry out a possibly complicated transformation globally; the risk of introducing defects; poor acceptance by collaborators or code owners (if doing the HPC-oriented update for others); coping with diverging 'performance' paradigms (different parallelism models, APIs for GPU, etc). The Coccinelle code transformation system can express a vast range of refactorings for C/C++ codebases as so-called 'semantic patches', that is programs in a special 'transformation' language. While 'semantic patches' are typically very short, they can radically transform arbitrary large codebases, thus coping with the above mentioned 'challenges'. This talk introduces the usage concept and shows sound, self-contained examples of HPC-oriented refactorings, including latest and upcoming features.",

          "description": "With Spark 4 in the pipeline for this year, many of us are looking at what will be involved in upgrading to the latest and greatest Spark. This talk will look at the open-source tooling we use to automate upgrading thousands of our Spark pipelines (from Spark 2.X -> 3.4) and how to we used a variation of the write-audit-publish technique to validate the new pipelines in production for pipelines that might have less testing than ideal. Seeing is a pre-requisite to believing, so the talk will include a short demo showing how the spark-upgrade tool works on a demo pipeline complete with \"live\" validation. In this talk, you will learn how to: Upgrade your Spark pipelines without crying* Validating Spark (and other similar) pipelines even when you don't trust the tests (by extending the write-audit-publish pattern) on top of Iceberg, Hudi, or Delta Lake. Time permitting, I will end with some exciting new (but non-backward compatible) changes coming in Spark 4 (tentatively scheduled for June, but it's software). *Not a guarantee, some upgrades may still cause tears Related links: https://github.com/holdenk/spark-upgrade - the upgrade tool being discussed https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/ - the code mod tool we used for scala https://pybowler.io/ - the python code refactoring tool we extended https://sqlfluff.com/ - the sql linting / cleanup tool we extended",

          "description": "RDF is the technology that powers many of the world's biggest datasets, serving as the backbone of the Linked Data ecosystem: over half of all websites serve RDF data, and massive datasets on topics such agriculture and transport are available openly from national governments and EU institutions. However, with several different RDF serialization formats in use, the inherent complexity of graph database topology and the ever-present risk of naming collisions on the Semantic Web, you wouldn't be alone in wondering how to tackle RDF data security effectively at scale. The W3C's RDF Canonicalization and Hash Working Group has been meeting since 2022 to answer this very question, by designing and standardizing a process to transform datasets into a single, canonical form. This talk will take you on a tour of the result of this work, the RDF Dataset Canonicalization algorithm: learn how canonicalization makes protecting datasets from malicious interference easier, from ensuring basic integrity to using RDF in digital credentials get an insight into the challenges posed by 'poison graphs' and how to guard against them in your data pipelines see what it looks like to run the algorithm on the command line and in your scripts using a 100% FOSS technology stack discover how the W3C's standardization process works and how to participate in the design of RDF specifications",

          "description": "Semantically-driven data management is an approach that focuses on the meaning and context of the data, rather than simply storing it. The semantic information can be used to drive workflows. The storage and retrieval of data can be optimized and specialised based on data semantics for different workflows. DASI (Data Access and Storage Interface) is a semantically-driven data store developed by ECMWF as part of the EuroHPC project IO-SEA. Based on the FDB object store library developed and in operational use at ECMWF, DASI manages data using its domain specific and scientifically meaningful metadata keys, and separates data management from the underlying backend storage technologies. This allows very fast and efficient algorithms to search for and retrieve data (based on its semantic meaning) from large datasets. DASI is modular and is compatible with multiple backends (e.g., POSIX, CEPH, DAOS) through a diverse API (Python, C++, C). We will explain the concept of semantic description of data and demonstrate DASI as a data management solution.",

          "description": "The Research Computing team at The Alan Turing Institute is responsible for allocating, managing and supporting access to HPC and Cloud services for a large number of researchers and projects. We provide access to all kinds of compute resources, from targeted Tier 2 HPC systems through to fungible credits for Cloud services that can be used for any available resource. Managing these resources efficiently can be challenging, especially when budget controls offered by Cloud service providers are limited with no way to prevent overspend by users. This presents serious challenges for adoption in research organisations like The Alan Turing Institute that need to centrally disseminate Cloud resources to researchers with independent budgets. In this talk we will present RCTab (Research Computing Tables), our open-source budget and subscription control system for Azure which enables central management of Cloud resources while enforcing strict budget controls. We will discuss the background to the tool and demonstrate its functionality, including budget allocation, usage monitoring and shut-down of resources when the budget has been consumed. We will also discuss our experiences developing the code in Python using the Azure REST API, including our experiences in converting the codebase of internally-used tools to a deployable, customisable and open source application with broader applicability through the use of the Pulumi Infrastructure as Code provisioning environment.

          "description": "Kubernetes is being used in more diverse use cases that require specialized hardware and system configurations per node. The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) project was initially created as a simple node labeler daemon to tackle the difficulties of heterogeneous clusters. However, recently, NFD has acquired numerous new capabilities, from custom node labeling to extended resources, node tainting, annotations, and topology discovery. NFD has a broad range of built-in capabilities to detect hardware and system configurations and has various extension points for third-party plugins. Additionally, NFD provides a CRD-based rule system that is expressive and flexible for updating node properties according to its discovered capabilities. This talk will demonstrate how NFD can be utilized to simplify cluster administration by automating aspects of node management, such as labeling and tainting.",

Various problems exist and a work group was established to identity and implement features in Kubernetes. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of the different components of Kubernetes and explain what work is being done to improve the experience of a HPC user on a Kubernetes cluster. The major focuses of this talk will be on the enhancements made to the Job API in Kubernetes. Various features for the Job API that will be expanded upon are Indexed Jobs, Suspended Jobs, Pod Failure Policy, and the Pod Replacement Policy. Even with this features in Job API, there is a need for an API that can represent a collection of Jobs. I will also present the JobSet project and give examples of how one can use this to run some common HPC patterns.",

          "description": "The high performance computing (HPC) community has an often tumultuous relationship with cloud, with advocates from both sides facing off in a West Side Story style fight. The costs, historical lack of focus on performance, and lack of transparency about supply of cloud resources is problematic. The lack of consistent, automated orchestration on HPC poses challenges for running complex emerging workflows. Cloud is growing rapidly and is projected to be the largest sector of computing by revenue 2025. Cloud's market-favored position makes it a primary source and beneficiary of innovations, allowing it to address limitations of HPC. HPC needs a strategy for integrating cloud technologies and collaborating with the cloud community. If our HPC community cannot successfully integrate cloud technologies and techniques we (and our science) will be left behind. To establish this foundation the community must adopt a new strategy - converged computing, or creating environments and technologies that combine the best of both worlds. In this talk I will discuss our innovative work toward this goal – implementing HPC technologies inside of Kubernetes, the de-facto standard workload orchestration framework, and Kubernetes inside of HPC. I will provide a brief history of our early work, including improving the default Kubernetes scheduler by way of testing more sophisticated graph-based scheduling (a project called Fluence), and implementing the entirety of an HPC workload manager inside of Kubernetes (the Flux Operator). Finally, I present the ultimate turducken - allowing for running machine learning and HPC applications (including the Flux Operator itself) inside of Kubernetes, inside of Flux. With this approach, we imagine a collaborative future where HPC users can deploy workloads seamlessly across environments, and encounter equality of automation and performance.",

          "description": "Web authentication is more complex then ever. While out-of-the-box 2FA features are helpful, sometimes developers need to customize authentication flows to meet specific business requirements, like registration, credential recovery, or adaptive security to step-up authentication based on risk scores. All IDPs have some kind of black magic to implement customizations--normally some script or code interface. But at the Janssen Project, we saw how hard it is to write, maintain and transfer this custom authentication code, and we wanted something more re-usable. So in early 2021, we introduced Agama, a low-code programming language to simplify the development of web identity journeys. Agama defines a standard way to build web identity journeys in a potentially vendor-neutral way. It’s both a programming language and a project archive format. In 2023, Gluu launched Agama Lab, a free developer tool. Agama Lab takes low code to a new level by enabling developers and architects to graphically white board identity journeys and to release deployable Agama archives directly to a GitHub repository. The Agama Lab Explore Catalog enables developers to fork working projects and adapt them more specific business requirements. Low code may seem silly--yes you can also just write the code. But low code can reduce the time to knowledge-transfer customizations to the next team. And graphical tools faciliate communciation with the non-identity team to help explain the various flows and how they relate.",

          "description": "Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), as a natural extension of Identity Management, is a core component of any IT infrastructure. It automates user processes (joiner, mover, leaver) and their accounts in the whole infrastructure. Access Management (AM) is an inherent partner of IGA. It provides authentication and, to some extent, authorization for end users. To reach the full potential of both IGA and AM, it is necessary to interconnect them. This talk will focus on open-source IGA midPoint and show how it can deliver extra features when well-integrated with an AM system. We will cover basics like providing information about users and their access to the AM. Then, we will focus on how information from AM can flow to IGA and enable features like just-in-time provisioning even to systems that do not support it natively. Moreover, the data from AM, like login timestamps, can enhance IGA reporting capabilities and even enable the preparation of complex access policies. That can further automate your processes for managing accounts and use to tighten security and even save money for usage and licencing costs. Ultimately, we will examine the partially implemented feature of midPoint for managing multilateral identities and use them to create a unified user profile. It envisioned this feature would interlace traditional on-premise identities (HR, student registry, customer databases, etc.) with identity federations, social, national and other IDs.",

          "description": "In recent years, there has been significant interest in the efficient implementation of cryptographic protocols for applications in IoT devices and smartphones. As network technologies advance and software development environments become more demanding, there is an inherent need for secure and efficient communications. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has garnered attention from developers due to its ability to produce more efficient cryptographic algorithms, serving as the foundational technology for blockchain. The Olympus library is one of the fundamental libraries used for developing encryption tools based on elliptic curves. Several cryptographic libraries have been developed to extend the library and implement pairing on elliptic curves, such as the pbc library, mcl library, miracle library. Thus, the performance of the functionality provided by the Olympus library is of high importance and impact. In this context, we propose performance optimizations to Olympus library for improving the performance without sacrificing the functionality and the advanced security characteristics of the library. More specifically, we improve the performance of the cryptographic functionality based on elliptic curves (GNU Crypto) provided by the Olympus library.",

          "description": "Passwordless authentication is becoming a trend and its usage will increase in the near future. Little by little we are seeing these authentication methods being added to the operating system (i.e. Passkey/FIDO2, External Identity Provider, etc.). However, its integration with the graphics stack leaves much to be desired. In the last months SSSD and GNOME teams have been working on improving this integration and providing a unified and consistent user experience for passwordless authentication mechanisms. This talk will present the current state, the problems that we have detected and the proposals for improvement. In addition, where possible, demonstrations of authentication mechanisms whose work is at an advanced stage of implementation will be provided.",

The talk will show how to automate FreeIPA deployment and configuration to integrate with Microsoft Active Directory and also how to configure and use External Identity Providers, using the ansible-freeipa project. Recent versions of ansible-freeipa allow id overrides for AD users, for example enabling an AD administrator to act as a FreeIPA administrator, performing tasks like enroll new clients, deploy or promote replicas, and manage users, also to use the self-service features. External IdP support has been recently added to FreeIPA. The registration with an integrated IdP enables FreeIPA to act as an OAuth 2.0 client to handle authentication of the user identity and authorize access to it. This integration and the required changes to users can be automated using ansible-freeipa. The talk will be closed by a demonstration of the configuration and integration of AD and External IdP.",

          "description": "With a move to cloud-based hosting of the application servers, a typical application is not a member of the same corporate IT environment anymore. Application servers often use OAuth 2.0 protocol flows to identify their users. Identity Providers (IdPs) provide OAuth 2.0 endpoints to applications and pull over the tasks of authenticating and authorizing users’ access to application resources. They become a central point of interaction between enterprise domains, if those still in use in the organization, and applications. This approach allows to integrate both in-house applications and cloud-based SaaS applications provided by third parties. The separation of enterprise IT architecture and an enterprise domain structure, however, leads to a larger issue. While in the past management of the application servers was part of the enterprise domain services (Active Directory, RHEL IdM, …) where regular users and application developers were present at the same time. Maintaining common access to these servers was easy: since the application server is enrolled into the domain, it can consume domain identities. Not anymore: there is no such guarantee to have both application servers and application developers belonging to the same domain. Effectively, there is a need to access information that is only available in a federated way: through some broker, like IdP. On top of that, the broker might not be able to pass through a certain type of information that might simply not exist on the other side. For example, for Linux servers working together as a compute capacity, it is crucial to have a uniform view on POSIX information about users and groups. But an IdP might simply lack this information because there might be no need for it at the place where a user account is defined. This talk aims to define a common set of requirements and approaches to represent a secure POSIX identity management integration with OAuth 2.0-based identity providers. Aside from requirements towards client software on the Linux platform, we aim to define possible requirements towards other components of the integration, based on our experience developing Samba, SSSD, and FreeIPA for more than 25 years.",

          "description": "We've all seen the memes about Google Chrome devouring all the available RAM in your laptop. Is that only due to how the browser works or is it also our fault as web apps developers? In fact, modern JS apps are becoming increasingly complicated, so their compute and memory requirement are rising as well, with some famous websites even taking up entire gigabytes of memory. This does not only fill up the memory of your users devices, but can also cause crashes and performance drops. How do we monitor if that's the case, and how can we fix it? This talk will shed some light on the dark art of memory allocations and profiling, showing how some data structures and some JS frameworks are less efficient than others. Also, what are the tools that are available to measure it, such as the Chrome Memory Profiler and MemLab, showcasing some custom tooling I've built around those two.",

Join me in 'Recycle, Reuse, Rebuild: Transformative Tactics for Turning Your Brownfields Green' as we navigate the intricacies of transforming this intricate system. I'll share experiences, guide you through my decision-making process, and impart valuable lessons learned. Explore the challenges of leveraging open source tools, particularly those resistant to customization. We'll address the common temptation to 'burn it all down' and start anew, emphasizing the strategic middle path of transformation. Discover how to plan for loosely coupled systems, decide when to repair or rebuild, and strike the right balance between open source and custom solutions. This isn't just about strategies; it's a dynamic conversation aimed at empowering you to transform your brownfields into greener, more sustainable JavaScript landscapes. This session will be informative and fun for anyone who's ever confronted the joys of working with legacy code.",

We'll explore how the Qwik framework delivers the minimal time-to-interactive for websites by utilizing the concept of Resumability as an efficient alternative to hydration. Qwik is a framework created by the creator of Angular, Misko Hevery, Qwik comes with a clear goal: achieving top performance, 0 javascript, pure HTML and great DX. Its philosophy is clear: make the fastest possible time-to-interactive. The framework delays the invocation of javascript as much as possible and invokes it only when it is needed. Participants will learn how to enhance loading performance and interactivity, which are among the factors known as Core Web Vitals, the key metrics that Google uses in its ranking algorithm. In this session, we will provide a comprehensive overview and understanding of LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift). By the end of this talk, attendees will possess the knowledge necessary to build performant and scalable websites.",

The Bee catchphrase is: a language that is easy to learn and helps you write bug-free programs. By this, I mean a language with syntax and semantics that have fewer corner cases and traps than JavaScript, and with user-defined dependent types that can spot errors TypeScript miss. This might sound ambitious, but in this talk, I aim to demonstrate that writing a compiler from scratch isn't that hard, with the good tricks, and well-defined abstractions.",

Well, let me tell you about mutation testing! Mutation testing is the act of testing your tests by verifying that they catch bugs. Of course, you can do this manually by inserting bugs and running the tests, but a mutation testing framework can do this for you! Join me and learn the basics of mutation testing and how to use StrykerJS, the mutation testing framework for JavaScript and friends. At the end of this talk, you'll be the one who is testing your tests, and it won't even cost you much time!",

          "description": "Every three months, the kernel community produces a new kernel version by integrating more than 400 pull requests coordinated between maintainers. For \"simple\" changes to a single subsystem, ad-hoc submissions work fine. But when changes affect a lot of subsystems, the submitter needs to take more of the matter in their own hands. Uwe has completed a few cleanup quests in the kernel involving hundreds of patches and there is no shortage of further ideas. In this talk he presents the tools and workflows for mainline contributions he uses to keep on top of things. This covers everything from patch creation, selecting the right recipients, sending out series, to tracking patch application by the respective subsystem maintainers. Tools mentioned include: git (e.g. notes, filter-branch, rebase), coccinelle, notmuch, b4 and scripting around these.",

The mkosi-kernel project (https://github.com/DaanDeMeyer/mkosi-kernel) intends to make hacking on the kernel as streamlined and painfree as possible. This talk will give a brief introduction to mkosi and mkosi-kernel, explaining how it can be used as a day to day tool for building and testing patches to the Linux Kernel. Unlike alternatives like virtme(-ng), instead of booting from the host rootfs, mkosi-kernel will always build a custom image and boot into that. This image can be of any distribution, with any number of packages required to test kernel changes. Additionally, this image can be booted in a virtual machine as a disk image, cpio, unified kernel image or using virtiofs. Furthermore, mkosi-kernel can build various associated userspace projects like xfstests and make these available in the booted virtual machine for easy access to integration tests. Of course mkosi-kernel will also build the kernel itself for you if requested, but a prebuilt kernel can also be provided.",

          "description": "Many programs use poll/select system calls to wait for events that are triggered by file descriptor I/O events. For instance, to write a library able to behave like a network stack (e.g. lwip and picoTCP) or a device, it's possible to implement functions like my_socket, my_accept, my_open and my_ioctl, as drop-in replacement of the system call counterparts. Additionally, it's possible to use dynamic library magic to rename/divert the system call requests to use their virtual implementation provided by the library. Unfortunately this approach cannot be applied to poll/select system calls because Linux doesn't have a system call that permits to generate synthetic generic events for a file descriptor, so it is not possible for libraries to provide file descriptors suitable for select/poll system calls. libvpoll permits to define file descriptors whose I/O events can be generated at user level. This permits to generate synthetic events for poll, select, ppoll, pselect, epoll, etc. The libvpoll library can use two different supports: a module that provides a virtual device and a kernel patch extending the eventfd system call. When neither are availables, a feature-limited emulation is provided as a fallback: based on pipe it manages only POLLIN and POLLOUT. This approach allows mixing real file descriptors with others provided by libraries as parameters of poll/select system calls. For example libvpoll has been used in picoxnet, a user-level network stack implemented as a library for the Internet of Threads. libvpoll, as well as the kernel device module, are already available in Debian.",

In this talk, we'll be looking at the current state of the user namespace, its most common limitations and annoyances, and then go over a proposed design for a second generation of user namespaces. Those rely on recent kernel features to provide a massively simpler and more flexible experience which should unblock the use of user namespaces for many! Expect a rather demo filled talk, highlighting the current mechanics of the user namespace and the proposed improvements to it.",

          "description": "The Linux Kernel TPM subsystem has been somewhat static for a while. For TPM2 (the standard TPM nowadays) it is used for IMA (PCR extensions), Periodic random number seeding and Trusted Keys (effectively TPM sealed data which may be piped securely to userspace because it can only be unwrapped by the kernel). The big upcoming change is adding encryption and HMAC security to all TPM transactions because of the threats from Interposers (hardware corrupted to snoop the TPM bus). This will be completely transparent to users, but infrastructure can be added to detect interposer compromises. This talk will outline how this works and the null seed scheme for detecting interposers. TPM keys (really TPM sealed data) have been around for a long time and can be used for things like storing the symmetric key for LUKS based dm-crypt. A recent innovation for the kernel was to adopt the standardised form for ASN.1 keys (so other tools can seal and unseal them) and the latest innovation will be to add TPM policy (including signed policies) to kernel keys. This talk will detail what TPM policy is, how it works and how it can be used by the kernel.",

What appears straight forward on the outset, can be quite serpentine on the everyday System-on-Chip: Devices may refuse to self-identify, require interaction to be addressable, or have - possibly circular - dependencies on other devices. Failure to account for this leads to unchaperoned devices, probe deferrals, and if one is very unlucky, runtime issues up to a bricked system. Ahmad has debugged a fair share of such issues, either during initial hardware bring-up, after kernel updates or when porting Linux drivers to the barebox bootloader. In his talk, he will introduce the Linux driver model with a focus on tracking dependencies and discuss how to debug and address common issues with tools like ftrace, dev_err_probe and fw_devlink.",

          "description": "The current implementation of seccomp's ADDFD uses the receive_fd_replace() helper, and the semantics of this are quite confusing. It does what it says on the tin: it replaces a file descriptor in the fd table of the trapped process. However, various kernel subsystems (e.g. epoll) take a copy of the file descriptor number for their internal data structures, in addition to a ref of the struct file. This creates all sorts of problems: epoll will not report events correctly since the new struct file * is not replaced in the epoll instance, and may generate errors, etc. We'll go over epoll's representation in detail along with our current in-production solution to fix all of this up from userspace. We'll also go over 1, a proposed solution for fixing up epoll in particular, that would require each instance of this to be manually fixed. We're looking for feedback on how to make this faster, and what any potential kernel fixing would look like.",

          "description": "Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data, negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single byte of the underlying cryptographic material. This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys. On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets. Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key management system.",

You have a tracing tool, but you don't know where to look for in the Linux networking stack? You have hunch where to look at, but can't filter efficiently to find your packet? Look no further, pwru is the tool that you need! Relying on the BTF information for the kernel, pwru can attach eBPF probes to all functions in the networking stack that take a socket buffer (skb) in their arguments, and provides a quick view of the packet's trajectory. It supports pcap filters for filtering packets, and can display additional context information such as the call stack for the probed functions or a dump of the whole socket buffer. This introduction to pwru covers the functioning of the tool, its basic usage, and highlights a couple of situations where Cilium developers have used pwru to quickly debug datapath issues.",

          "description": "Most of the day to day tests in LLVM are regression tests executed by Lit, structured as source code or IR to be passed to some binary, rather than test code directly calling the code to be tested. This has many advantages but can make it difficult to predict which code path is executed when the compiler is invoked with a certain test input, especially for edge cases where error handling is involved. The goal of this work was to help developers create good test coverage for their patch and enable reviewers to verify that they have done so. To accomplish this we have introduced a tool that can be fed a patch as input, add coverage instrumentation for the affected source files, runs Lit tests, and records which test cases cause each counter to be executed. For each counter we then report the test cases executing the counter, but perhaps more importantly we also report the test cases executing the counter that are also changed in some way by the patch, since a modified line that results in zero counter isn’t properly tested, unless it’s intended to be a non-functional change. In this presentation, we will understand what are the technologies involved, the shortcomings to implement the solution, the idea of implementation, and the final demo result by using a llvm-project patch.",

The group is relatively young and continues to evolve and optimize its processes. In the first part of this presentation, I'll describe how the group was established, and what it has achieved so far. I'll briefly summarize the kinds of reports we've received. The second part of the presentation will cover remaining challenges faced by the group and the LLVM project related to the handling of security issues. These include \"how to communicate security issues to everyone who should know\", \"defining a threat model/what is a security issue\", better making use of github's security-supporting features, and improving implementation details on how to report issues.",

Right now, it is a complete desktop system that is already used by many, with a familiar GNOME interface and thousands of packages, targeting 5 CPU architectures. In this talk I would like to focus on my experiences using the toolchain, what obstacles got in the way, how I dealt with them, the issues that are still left and I would like to see addressed, the many benefits using LLVM gave the project, and overall give the audience an insight into practical deployment of LLVM in a project where it isn't simply a drop-in alternative to GCC.",

It is commonly located found as compilation_database.json in the build directory. With tools like compdb, you can modify the file according to your needs. clangd itself provides a flexible configuration file. But what if you require more flexibility or have specific needs for your code base? In this introductory presentation I give a brief overview of how Clang utilizes the compilation database and discuss the reasons and methods for extending it. Clang's CompilationDatabasePlugin allows extending and modifying compilation commands directly in your tooling at runtime. I show an example plugin that uses custom heuristics to find compiler flags for unknown files, e.g. for header files. Plugins can interface with other Clang and LLVM components and writing one is a great way to get started writing Clang-based tooling.",

          "description": "Intel Graphics Compiler (IGC) is a LLVM-based open-source project, which supports multiple operating systems and configurations. Thus, the project must support multiple versions of LLVM spanning form LLVM 9 to LLVM 14 and soon more recent versions. This talk focuses on mechanisms and practices that we use to support changes and inconsistencies between various versions of LLVM's unstable C++ API. The presentation will also cover our plans for supporting newer LLVM versions. The challenge of upgrading to most recent versions comes from major API changes originating from the shift to opaque pointers in LLVM-IR. Due to the nature of GPU workloads, IGC must support a number of domain-specific types (textures, samplers) which were modelled internally as typed pointers. The aim of the presentation is to share our experience with other maintainers and developers of LLVM-based projects. Intel Graphics Compiler is available here: https://github.com/intel/intel-graphics-compiler/",

          "description": "WebAssembly (WASM) enables us to use sandbox environments on edge devices and servers as well as browsers so that we can distribute platform-independent and secure applications. Previously, we could compile from several programming languages to WASM binary, but cannot generate them if we cannot use original source codes. In this talk, Masashi will introduce \"elfconv\", an AOT compiler that translates Linux/AArch64 ELF binary into LLVM bitcode targeting WASM. This compiler generates an LLVM bitcode that translates every instruction of the original ELF binary based on remill (library for lifting machine code to LLVM IR) and uses emscripten to generate the WASM binary. we can execute the generated WASM binary using Wasm Runtime (e.g. Wasmedge, Wasmtime). This talk will describe the technical details (methods to translate to LLVM bitcode and emulate Linux syscall targeting WASM) of elfconv and the performance of translating and future perspectives.

We are especially interested in using this interface to map addresses used in load/store instructions to equivalent source-level memory references. The primary objective of this project is to enhance the effectiveness of compiler-generated remarks and analysis reports for code optimization. These messages, while often comprehensive, lack direct connections to the corresponding source-level expressions. The goal is to bridge this gap by utilizing LLVM's intrinsic functions, which establish mappings between LLVM program entities and source-level expressions. The project specifically focuses on utilizing these intrinsic functions to generate or derive source expressions from LLVM values. This functionality is particularly important for enhancing memory access optimizations, including the reporting of memory access dependences that hinder vectorization.",

Kuhn began his work in the software freedom movement as a volunteer in 1992 — as an early adopter of Linux-based systems and contributor to various FOSS projects, including Perl. He worked during the 1990s as a system administrator and software developer for various companies, and taught AP Computer Science at Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati. Kuhn’s non-profit career began in 2000, when he was hired by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). As FSF’s Executive Director from 2001–2005, Kuhn led FSF’s GPL enforcement, launched its Associate Member program, and invented the Affero GPL. Kuhn began as SFC’s primary volunteer from 2006–2010, and became its first staff person in 2011. Kuhn's work at SFC focuses on enforcement of the GPL agreements, FOSS licensing policy, and non-profit infrastructural solutions for FOSS. Kuhn holds a summa cum laude B.S. in Computer Science from Loyola University in Maryland, and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Cincinnati. Kuhn's Master's thesis discussed methods for dynamic interoperability of Free Software programming languages. Kuhn received the Open Source Award in 2012, and the Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 2021 — both in recognition for his lifelong policy work on copyleft licensing and its enforcement."

          "description": "Panel: Open Core or Open Washing? Effects of Red Hat's Centos policy \"Open Source is eating software itself faster than software is eating the world.\" (OSSC) In 2023, Red Hat has continued to change their rules of how to handle RHEL source code. RHEL is now definitely Open Core, but still most of the code is available - just not all of it. This is only handed over to customers, which are free to share but will be \"kicked\" out by Red Hat if they do. The situation is difficult and complicated: While Red Hat claims this is totally compliant with open source definitions, many NGOs and OSS people differ. At the same time, there is new opencore summits (https://opencoresummit.com/), organized by investment capital (https://oss.capital/), defining \"COSS\" as the best OSS ever (C is for commercial, open core OSS). More and more companies are adapting the model, while Amazon and other companies are moving away from Red Hat, embracing \"truly free\" software. One thing is for sure: IBM and Red Hat have large legal departments and a lot of experience. But how should we - the open source community handle this? After all, there's many companies out there that can't or don't know how to do business with open source software. Many complaim similar like \"The better we make our software the worse our turnaround - because people don't need support any more...\" I would like to host a panel with journalists, NGOs (FSFE?) and a large audience to discuss what we can or should do, if these moves are legit or just openwashing?

          "description": "A story from the PostgreSQL project Copyright, patents, and trademarks are the three pillars of intellectual property law. FLOSS was born out of a desire for a new arrangement of copyright. This has been very successful and ample information and support exists for contributors and projects. Software patents have been discussed extensively, and, well, there is an uneasy stalemate(?). Trademarks have, in my experience, not received the same amount of attention. In the PostgreSQL project, we have for several years now worked to sort out how to deal with trademark issues, what and how to register, what uses to allow, how to allow them, and we have dealt with some unfortunate and tiresome conflicts. The PostgreSQL project is not sponsored by a single company or association, which makes all of this even more complicated. We had to figure a lot of this out on our own (with legal help), and there was not the same wealth of information available like for example for copyright. I want to share our experiences, get some feedback, and make some suggestions to the wider community about what kinds of resources would be (or would have been) useful.",

          "description": "This talk will first have a look at the previous German rulings on GPL-violations. We will see that the courts were only asked and only ordered that the defendant may not distribute the GPLed software in a GPL-violating way. This leaves one wondering whether the courts would order a defendant to no longer distribute the software at issue at all. This question essentially goes to section 4 of the GPLv2; the so called termination clause. A look into the German Civil Code (sect. 534) reveals us that such automatic termination clauses have to be read as rescission clauses (i.e. as manual termination). We will then look at the sections of the Civil Code which deals with rescission in generally and learn about the separation principle. The talk will conclude with a summary what the copyright holder faced with GPL-violations best does under German law.",

          "description": "The Swiss Parliament passed a new law in March 2023 that requires federal government agencies to publish all government software under an open source license. The new \"Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Official Tasks\" (EMBAG, Article 9 \"Open Source Software\" https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/fga/2023/787/de) went into effect on January 1, 2024. It is the result of 12 years of lobbying by the Swiss Parliamentary Group for Digital Sustainability to ensure that the law not only allows governments to publish open source code, but actually makes it the default process (https://www.ti8m.com/en/blog/open-source-gesetz-schweiz). The presentation will outline the history of the legislative process and present the current open source activities of Swiss government agencies, also in the context of the ongoing political debate on digital sovereignty (https://www.inside-it.ch/lasst-uns-die-digitale-souveraenitaet-nicht-verschlafen). The subsequent discussion will focus on what the Swiss government should do next to successfully implement the law. Suggestions such as establishing an Open Source Programme Office (OSPO) like the EU and launching a national Open Source development platform like OpenCoDE in Germany are on the table. More input is needed since Switzerland lacks a strong open source culture compared to other European countries.",

Kuhn began his work in the software freedom movement as a volunteer in 1992 — as an early adopter of Linux-based systems and contributor to various FOSS projects, including Perl. He worked during the 1990s as a system administrator and software developer for various companies, and taught AP Computer Science at Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati. Kuhn’s non-profit career began in 2000, when he was hired by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). As FSF’s Executive Director from 2001–2005, Kuhn led FSF’s GPL enforcement, launched its Associate Member program, and invented the Affero GPL. Kuhn began as SFC’s primary volunteer from 2006–2010, and became its first staff person in 2011. Kuhn's work at SFC focuses on enforcement of the GPL agreements, FOSS licensing policy, and non-profit infrastructural solutions for FOSS. Kuhn holds a summa cum laude B.S. in Computer Science from Loyola University in Maryland, and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Cincinnati. Kuhn's Master's thesis discussed methods for dynamic interoperability of Free Software programming languages. Kuhn received the Open Source Award in 2012, and the Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 2021 — both in recognition for his lifelong policy work on copyleft licensing and its enforcement."

          "description": "Verilog-AMS is a standardised modelling language widely used in analog and mixed-signal design, but without an open reference implementation. Gnucap is a modular mixed-signal circuit simulator that partially implements Verilog-AMS, that aspires to eventually implement the complete language. In 2023, with NLnet support, we made significant progress in support for Verilog-AMS, the \"analog\" part, also known as Verilog-A, both on the simulator side and in the model compiler. For 2024, we will extend the work, concentrating on three tasks. The first is extensions to modelgen, the model compiler, essentially completing the analog part of Verilog-AMS, with some digital. The second task is enhancements to the simulator, mostly related to fast simulation of large mixed circuits, with both analog and digital parts. The first and second tasks are related to the \"mixed-signal\" aspect of Verilog-AMS. The third task addresses interoperability with other software, including schematic entry and layout, ability for Gnucap to use device models from other simulators, for modelgen to generate code to be used with other simulators, and porting some analysis commands.",

          "description": "Simple-V is a RISC-uniform loop subsystem that at its heart is similar to x86 REP. Advanced features are more like Z80 CPIR and LDIR. It turns out that basic software for/while loops with conditional exit fit very well with Simple-V, including single and double linked-list walking, null-terminated string copy, and many others. This talk therefore goes through a sequence of algorithms showing dramatic 50x reduction in code size compared to \"usual\" SIMD assembler of other ISAs, whilst still retaining the hardware-level parallelism that SIMD is supposed to be the world lead at. examples include strncpy, positional popcount, FORTRAN MAXLOC, and even small in-register sorting algorithms (such as insertion sort).

          "description": "The semiconductor industry has been evolving and innovating for the past 75 years, ever since the first semiconductor transistor was invented. This rapid growth is driven by the direct and proactive contribution of the FOSS CAD/EDA to the entire technology flow: from state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies, device level compact/SPICE modeling, its Verilog-A standardization to advanced IC designs for various HiTech applications. However, the semiconductor industry also faces many challenges in maintaining the growth of its workforce with skilled technicians and engineers. To address the increasing need for well-trained workers worldwide, we need to find innovative ways to attract skilled talent and strengthen the local semiconductor workforce ecosystem. The FOSS CAD/EDA tools with the recently available open access PDKs provide a new platform to connect IC design beginners, enthusiasts and experienced mentors to benefit from the collaboration opportunities enabled by the fast-growing open-source IC design movement. FOSS IC design collaboration is increasingly possible due to the rapid growth of open access PDKs recently offered by SkyWater, GF and IHP. This paper demonstrates the FOSS CAD/EDA contribution to the SPICE/Verilog-A modeling/standardization, compete IC design flow (Xschem, Qucs-S, ngspice, Xyce, OpenVAF, OpenEMS, Magic, kLayout, OpenRoad) as well as selected open source analog/RF and digital IC design examples.",

Matrix already serves as such a layer, though can be quite complex. In this talk we explore Matrix's existing interoperability considerations, how Linearized Matrix works and interoperates at the room level, and the interactions with MIMI's latest protocol document work. This talk will be fairly technical as it deals with the algorithms embedded at the individual room level, including event authorization, state resolution, and the associated security properties and models.",

          "description": "Large companies in the IT and banking industry typically build their own custom apps to communicate with their customers, often storing unencrypted customer data on their backend servers. While it may be acceptable for companies to store data in unencrypted form on a company's server, governments have a greater responsibility for their citizens' data. You are free to use private sector offers or not. In contrast, public administration has a de facto monopoly on many services that require social, medical and other information that is vulnerable to stigmatization. Some governments have created their own custom-built solutions where communication takes place via insecure services with no end-to-end-encryption in place. The German identity system BundID, for example, contains a communication component that stores unencrypted messages on central servers. This poses a major risk to privacy in the event of IT security incidents. If all goes well, Germany's infrastructure might get an upgrade and will use Matrix as its new communication protocol in the future (see https://gitlab.opencode.de/fitko/rueckkanal-ueber-messengerdienste) In this talk, I would like to discuss the benefits and need for an open, end-to-end-encrypted messaging protocol for building secure (cross-border) communication platforms for the public administration. Let's explore the challenges and requirements for Matrix-based Government-to-Citizen (G2C) communication!",

          "description": "A generic Real Time (RTC) layer for the matrix ecosystem and client implementations While matrix is an instant messaging system it still stores all events. To empower a vision where matrix can truly be used to develop any real-time experience, one must develop a client and leverage it on all parts. This process splits matrix into events stored in the DAG, allowing for asynchronous communication and collaboration, as well as low-latency synchronized communication. To realize this, matrix needs a standardized signaling system for establishing real time (WebRTC) connections between all participants and allow to exchange media and data streams. In this talk we will present the journey of building Element Call and FluffyChat as MatrixRTC applications and present the findings we made to make this a stable extensible and secure infrastructure that leverages all the amazing features of matrix. We will give a technical introduction to the MSC's making up MatrixRTC and explain the decisions made. We will also explain how we implemented it in FluffyChat and how it integrates with native mobile operating systems like Android and iOS. We will present Element Call and FluffyChat, with per-sender-key-end-to-end-encryption, that also leverages the matrix account verification to guarantee the authenticity of participants. Which makes it one of the most secure digital real time communication method.",

          "description": "In the recent years I have worked a lot on building community Internet services using distributed systems, in the context of Deuxfleurs, a French self-hosting collective. We use distributed systems with nodes in different physical locations to help us tolerate temporary failures such as Internet links going down, as well as hardware failures of our low-cost, second-hand servers. We built our platform as a set of microservices, taking the form of Docker containers orchestrated by Nomad (a smaller Kubernetes). This allows us to divide our workload in pieces that can be ran on one or many machines simultaneously, and that can in most cases be automatically moved from one geographical region to another in case of failure. This approach works relatively well, however I am frustrated to no end by the idiosyncraties of containers and the Linux/UNIX ecosystem in general which contains huge piles of legacy and is massively getting in our way for building a clean, declarative and resilient dynamic microservice architecture. I have a dream that one day we can build an orchestrator for microservices that is built on a microkernel, component-based operating system. We just need a way to simply multiplex fundamental resources such as storage and networking (NOT a filesystem, and NOT a full TCP/IP stack with iptables or whatnot), and to schedule and run unikernels or tiny Linux VMs in a cluster of machines. How hard can that be? I will do a brief talk at the beginning but I'm hoping for this session to be mostly just talking of what can be done in this direction.",

          "description": "One of the key aspects of Unikernels is modularity: each component can be considered a standalone library that users selectively incorporate into their Unikernel. This design flexibility empowers users to create minimal and specialized images tailored for individual applications. Despite the advantageous compartmentalization, the process of building a Unikernel remains monolithic. Users must download the Unikernel framework, along with any external dependencies, and engage in a build-from-scratch procedure, even with minimal code changes. We propose Bunny, a novel build system that aims to simplify the process of building Unikernels. Bunny creates an alternative build process, making full use of the modular aspect of Unikernels. We structure Bunny using a layered approach, where each component represents a distinct layer. Users do not need to build each component from scratch; instead, each respective layer is fetched and can be used to produce the resulting Unikernel image. Moreover, Bunny keeps track of all the dependencies for each component, relieving users from the pain of manually identifying and building all the dependencies.",

The recently formed Unikernel Alliance consortium, as a direct result of this devroom (FOSDEM'23), aims to evangelize unikernels to technical, academic and commercial parties. Still, a common issue is one of usability and reaching parity with Linux-based and Docker-based deployment. We're excited to announce that we are now there. We are now at the point where we can use unikernels as a drop in replacement for containers, improving performance, resource consumption, cost and security. In this talk we take a tour on Unikraft, an open source unikernel development kit, and its companion tool, KraftKit. We demonstrate how to easily build, package, run and deploy common applications with Unikraft, benefiting from its focus on specialization. With its POSIX compliant interface, Unikraft allows seamless integration of existing Linux applications. KraftKit provides the tooling layer to allow every action to be one command line away: building your preferred application, running it natively or on a remote setup, starting a debug session and many more. The talk will be practical, filled with demonstrations with different applications running on top of Unikraft and pointing out resources and information for integrating Unikraft and KraftKit into your workflow, be it research, hobbyist / professional or commercial.",

          "description": "MPI applications are parallel applications that require CPU, memory and high-throughput channels to communicate. These applications are usually deployed on top of a general purpose operating system that provides services like memory allocation, process creation, inter-process communication and networking. The resources like memory or CPU are shared with other processes in the system and with the OS itself. The MPI application competes for host's resources thus limiting its scalability. In this talk, we present the recent effort to build an implementation of the MPI standard on top of the Toro unikernel. In this deployment, we provide a minimalist implementation of the MPI standard as a library that compiles with the application and the kernel thus resulting in a single binary that can be deployed as microVM. Such a library leverages the parallelism that Toro proposes to effectively deploy a MPI application. Some of the benefits of using Toro are one instance per core, cooperative scheduler without preemption and local resources. To benchmark our implementation, we port some the OSU Micro-Benchmarks and run them in the Intel Xeon Gold platform. We report the benefits of our architecture when comparing it with existing MPI implementation on Linux.",

This unikernel image is much more lightweight than traditional VM images, which contain a full-blown Linux Distribution. We are talking Megabytes in size instead of Gigabytes. That's because the unikernel image can be specialized to the application that runs and the environment that the image runs in. Having only one application per VM also allows Hermit to be a single address space operating system. That means we don't have to do any context switches between user space and kernel spaces and every system call becomes a function call into the library operating system. In this talk, we will present the highlights of last year's developments in Hermit. These are the topics we will cover:",

Instead, being binary compatible with Linux promises that you can use a unikernel as a simple drop-in replacement, especially for running container workloads. But how can we avoid redeveloping Linux for compatibility reasons? What about fork, clone and co. while maintaining a single address space? Where can we still specialize and keep performance benefits? In this talk we will dive into our efforts over the last year with Unikraft for binary compatibility with Linux. We'll discuss the challenges we have solved, the lessons we have learned, and the optimizations we have been able to make. In all of this, we have set the goal of not requiring to recompile any application code.",

          "description": "From the beginning, OSv has been designed to implement a subset of the Linux flavor of POSIX API. Initially, most Linux applications had to be re-compiled from source as shared libraries. Starting with the release 0.54.0, it has become possible to run unmodified Linux position-independent executables (so-called \"PIEs\") and position-dependent executables \"as-is\". In my presentation, I will talk about how OSv has been enhanced to support running statically linked executables. Not only that, the same improvements make it possible to execute dynamically linked executables via Linux dynamic linker. I will also briefly describe a newly added strace-like capability aimed to help analyze system calls on the fly. Finally, I will also explain how we have implemented the ENA networking driver and thus made it possible to run OSv on AWS Nitro EC2 instances.",

During the day he is busy designing and building components of the video supply chain for CNN at WarnerBros Discovery.

He has been contributing to the project since 2016, when he first got exposed to and fascinated by OSv. During this time, he has contributed over 800 patches, which most notably involved enhancing OSv to run on AWS firecracker (http://blog.osv.io/blog/2019/04/19/making-OSv-run-on-firecraker/) and improving ARM port. Finally, he gave a presentation about OSv at the P99 conference in 2021 (https://www.p99conf.io/session/osv-unikernel-optimizing-guest-os-to-run-stateless-and-serverless-apps-in-the-cloud/) and FOSDEM23 (https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/osvevolution/)."

          "description": "The Genode OS Framework is certainly not a newcomer and has seen continuous improvements in its quarterly releases for more than 15 years. Sculpt, the Genode-based desktop OS, has been around for more than five years and has proven itself to be fit for day-to-day use. Moreover, Sculpt OS has more recently been adapted to the PinePhone. With this solid foundation, application development for Genode comes brightly into the picture. For this purpose, the Goa tool has been initiated by Norman Feske in 2019 as a side project. By moving Goa under the umbrella of Genode's core developer team, the tool has seen various improvements over the past year. In this talk, I will present the concepts behind Goa and walk you through the streamlined application development process: from importing 3rd-party source code, over test-running on the host system, to packaging and publishing the result for Sculpt OS.",

At that time, Genode's component-based OS design inspired his own research for more than seven years. With an ever-growing enthusiasm towards the framework he became a full-time Genode developer in 2021."

          "description": "TLS is one of today's most widely used and best-analyzed encryption technologies. However, for historical reasons, TLS for email protocols is often not used directly but negotiated via STARTTLS. This additional negotiation added complexity and was prone to security vulnerabilities such as naive STARTTLS stripping or command injection attacks in the past. We performed the first structured analysis of STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3, and IMAP and introduced a semi-automatic testing toolkit (EAST) to analyze email clients. We used EAST to analyze 28 email clients and 23 email servers, resulting in over 40 STARTTLS related issues. Only 3 out of 28 clients and 7 out of 23 servers did not show any STARTTLS-specific security issues. We conclude that STARTTLS is error-prone to implement, under-specified in the standards, and should be avoided.",

          "description": "IMAP is a lot. It's a stateful protocol that doesn't lend itself to a simple implementation and can be intimidating. IMAP's syntax is branched, subtle, and has various issues. Above that, the syntax is intertwined with business logic, making separating concerns difficult. It doesn't help either that there are more than 70 extensions, with any of them potentially breaking your understanding of how IMAP operates. In this talk, Simon and Damian recapitulate what they learned about IMAP while implementing/maintaining go-imap and imap-codec. After the talk, you will have a much better understanding of IMAP and, hopefully, will avoid making the same mistakes we made. Simon started writing go-imap v1 7 years ago. Of course, misunderstandings happened, and mistakes were made. Thus, he started working on go-imap v2 earlier this year to fix these mistakes and design a better API informed on everything he learned while maintaining this library. Damian started imap-codec during a STARTTLS research project. imap-codec was born out of frustration. He struggled to construct syntactically valid IMAP messages while analyzing IMAP clients for a specific behavior. imap-codec helped to prevent the same errors from being made twice.",

It keeps the most important technical properties of those protocols, but ditches many things that hold back improvements and hamper developers. It's built on commonly understood and implemented standards, which makes it easy to get up and running and easy to benefit from modern systems like push notifications. It's built as a syncing protocol, providing easy sync features in a data agnostic way. JMAP is still young, but there are multiple implementations of both client and server. The most notable install of JMAP is at Fastmail, where it's the primary interface to all customer data. This talk will cover what JMAP looks like, the principles under which it operates, and how to get started working with it. We will discuss the likely next steps in JMAP's rollout and how Fastmail uses JMAP internally for its own datatypes.",

          "description": "A few years ago, in Vienna, we founded grommunio. With the help of many open source tools, from Dovecot to Postfix and many more, a revolutionary open source groupware was born. On top of the classic open source stack, we implemented APIs and protocols of Microsoft's Exchange (and later MS 365 server) in free, opensource versions, one by one. This way, we built a \"drop-in\"-replacement for MS Exchange that supports unmodified, plugin-free clients with Outlook, Android, Apple and Web clients, all out of the box. And it comes with chat, video conferences, file sync, administration, domain, user and account management and much more. Most recently we implemented Exchange Web services. In this talk, we will have a look at how we re-implemented the protocols and how it works with clients. We'll talk about problems, solutions and quirks of our work and the challenges of both supporting many older versions and following Microsoft's newest developments. Our support for Microsoft Exchange (and other) protocols follows the protocol specifications of EWS, EAS (Exchange ActiveSync), RPCH, MAPI/HTTP (NSPI, OXCFXICS, OXDSCLI and many others)",

The commercial vendors of mail security products show off using many advanced buzzwords to advertise their features. It seems they have magic algorithms to catch every threat. And you can only buy it in their shop. Is there any chance to build a mail security platform with open-source components on-prem that is at least as effective?? With the help of a robust MTA infrastructure and the excellent anti-spam solution and mail-framework Rspamd we would like to show you that most of the buzzword ideas are covered by Rspamd or could be queried by Rspamd. All we need is good reputation data - selfmade, commercial or from the community. Let's have a look if we can compete with commercial vendors and build up an Enterprise Mail Security using open-source.",

          "description": "Helplines and NGOs working with sensitive populations in at-risk areas require a robust, secure but also usable communication tooling. They need to have a system that lets anyone contact them in a secure and pseudonymous way, without revealing who manages the hotline; they also need to be able to organize their internal workflow securely and safely enroll new members. We have conducted a user survey among grassroots helplines in Eastern Europe and identified several common traits: first, they rely on a patchwork of tools (messaging apps, cloud storage, task trackers) therefore multiplying potential vulnerabilities; second, they are critical towards popular secure messaging apps that either leak your phone numbers (e.g. Signal), or do not guarantee end-to-end encryption (e.g. Telegram) or may seem tricky to onboard for non-techies (e.g. Element). What we propose is a chat-mail service using Delta Chat messaging suite, adapted specifically for hotlines and NGOs. Delta Chat is a federated, crossplatform, free and open source messaging app that works over email and offers state of the art end-to-end encryption using Autocrypt and SecureJoin with multiple audits. During this presentation we will demonstrate how our chat-mail service can help high-risk user groups. We will specifically focus on instant onboarding, shared account management, account portability, guaranteed end-to-end encryption and embedded collaborative chat-apps (\"webxdc\") such as notepads, calendars, task trackers etc. We will also share user stories from the field, since all these features are tested with real hotlines.",

It's currently also subject of a standardization initiative in the IETF's SML working group. The demo will show a plugin for Roundcube Webmail which allows users to receive and process structured email and also to compose email messages sent to others. It will also highlight structured vacation notices as one particular use case. Those build upon the Sieve vacation extension and the corresponding Roundcube plugin. The structured email Roundcube plugin is partly funded by NLnet (https://nlnet.nl/project/StructuredEmail/)",

          "description": "Finding your travel details in booking emails can be difficult sometimes, especially when those are ad-infested HTML monstrosities. It would be much more convenient if your email client could just extract and display the relevant information automatically, and offer higher-level actions for those, such as adding entries to your calendar or feeding data into dedicated apps. In theory this use-case is covered by semantic annotations using the schema.org ontology that can be embedded in HTML content and thus also in emails. In theory. For KDE's travel assistant app Itinerary we have built a semantic data extractor specialized on travel documents and which is embedded in KMail and Nextcloud Mail. In this talk we'll look at how that works and how well the above mentioned theory fares in practice.",

Therefore, to help developers enhance this instrumenting approach, the OpenTelemetry project leverages analytical capabilities by expanding the possibilities to collect and export telemetry data from Node.js applications. In this talk, I will share an easy way how the audience can achieve the auto-instrumenting of a Node.js application using the OpenTelemetry Operator.",

Picking only data points that describe your system well is key for understanding your system while staying cost effective. Based on a real world example, this session discusses different sampling techniques such as head based and tail based sampling, and helps you find a suitable strategy to match your telemetry data. We will guide you through incrementally building architectures that evolve with your operation, empowering your system to adapt seamlessly. After this session, you will be able to select the most valuable data points from your telemetry data and design an architecture around it.",

          "description": "At Polar Signals we have worked with the maintainers of someone of the most used Linux distributions. The recently announced enabling of frame pointers of [a Linux distribution] is going to be a leap forward for observability. By enabling frame pointers by default, we're lowering the barrier to entry for performance profiling and debugging, meaning: Simplified Profiling: Dive straight into profiling without worrying about compiler configurations. Lower Overhead: Unwinding with frame pointers is significantly cheaper than using DWARF or DWARF-derived information. Debugging Accessibility: Even those new to profiling can access high-quality data, democratising the process of performance optimisation. It will allow bcc-tools, bpftrace, perf and other such tooling to work out of the box. Ecosystem Benefit: [distribution] comprises thousands of open source projects, and we'll work to upstream performance fixes that we find across potentially thousands of packages wherever we can. In this talk we're going to do a deep dive in the above topic and will learn how administrators and users can benefit from the work starting today.",

New distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or, more recently, Grafana Tempo help drill down to individual transactions and understand application-level performance. However, with millions of users or request IDs, capturing metrics for high cardinality fields is a real challenge. In this talk, we will introduce Quickwit, a cloud-native search engine, as a solution to manage this data efficiently within Grafana. After briefly introducing Quickwit’s architecture, this session will offer a practical guide on sending traces to Quickwit OpenTelemetry-compatible API and using Grafana for analyzing traces analysis and deriving metrics on high-cardinality fields in a Grafana dashboard.",

This presentation will offer an in-depth overview of the journey we've undertaken in building Netdata, highlighting the challenges we've faced and the innovative solutions we've developed to address them. In this presentation, we will delve into the history of Netdata, starting from its inception. We'll discuss the initial goals of creating a monitoring tool that could offer high-resolution metrics, auto-detection of metrics, and real-time visualization, all with minimal configuration required. We'll also explore how Netdata garnered rapid attention and support from the open-source community. The presentation will then shift focus to the evolution of Netdata, including the development of: Next, we'll discuss Netdata's transition into a distributed monitoring solution and the decision to seek funding to build a sustainable company around the open-source project. We'll emphasize the core concept of the Netdata SaaS model, which keeps monitoring features open-source while offering additional benefits like better integration, RBAC, and support through the SaaS platform. The presentation will showcase how Netdata's architecture allows for distributed monitoring, vertical and horizontal scalability, and real-time visibility across infrastructure. We'll discuss the challenges faced and overcome, such as the creation of a custom database engine, the streaming protocol as a fundamental element of the distributed nature of Netdata, the introduction of unsupervised anomaly detection, the implementation of distributed queries, the need for clarity and transparency during visualization and the user interface concepts we used to avoid providing a query editor to users. We'll also touch upon the challenges that remain, such as the use of WebRTC for browser-to-agent communication, the need to standardize metric naming conventions, the development of an expert system for metric interpretation, the support of infrastructure-level alerts in a distributed fashion and standardizing user experiences. By the end of this presentation, the audience will gain a deep understanding of Netdata's evolution, its unique features, and the challenges and solutions encountered along the way. They will also take away insights into building and maintaining large-scale open-source projects, as well as actionable ideas for improving their own monitoring and observability solutions.",

          "description": "Generative AI in 2024 has a consent problem. Scraped and otherwise stolen datasets are used to produce output that can directly compete with the people who generated the source data. This doesn’t have to be our future. The Common Voice project collects volunteer donated speech data to freely offer academics, industry and language activists a future where meaningful linguistic diversity is built into the digital products and services that increasingly fill our world. By teaching computers the way that real people speak, Common Voice doesn’t just offer a better connected future for global users, but presents us with one possible consent led model for community driven data collection. Together, let’s explore how community led dataset collection, design and governance structures have developed across speech datasets and look at how freely donated data, data trusts and other consent led collection models could offer a less dystopian AI future. An exploratory look at the proliferation of consent led data collection models in speech datasets, looking not only at Common Voice's CC0 donation-led approach but also looking into how data collection and governance models that offer more granular data control (like language community led data trusts) could offer AI and all of us touched by AI a less dystopian path into the future.",

Appropriately, she is the technology community manager for Common Voice, helping teach computers the way that real people speak. In her free time she teaches free web development bootcamps online and loves hiking. She always wants to chat about languages, hear about your projects or see pictures of your pets."

          "description": "After fixing HTTP/2 (H2) upload speed bugs in 2023 (Bug 1596576), Mozilla's Networking team started to focus on HTTP/3 (H3) upload speed (Bug 1852924). The H3 upload speed problem is inherently different from the one in H2. H2 benefits from the mature, operating system-level TCP networking stack. H3 on the other hand is build on top of QUIC, which lacks an operating system API. All networking operations have to be handled in user space. This talk is about the journey of discovering and fixing various H3 upload speed bugs in Firefox using Wireshark, logging, i/o-graphs and more.",

          "description": "Building the web is becoming more complex, with more tools, techniques, and acronyms to digest. As a beginner, it can be a nightmare to figure out where to start. And with all this newfound complexity, knowledge has been lost on the way. Accessibility has taken a step backward, and the modern web feels a bit more \"cookie cutter\" than it perhaps did. How can we turn things around? In this talk, Chris Mills looks at the MDN Curriculum, a new blueprint for learning front-end fundamentals that aims to give new developers all they need to find a job and build a better, more accessible web.",

In this talk we will explore building extensions that work across web browsers and operating systems and ways to overcome challenges caused by cross-browser differences. As we walk through extension code samples, we will discuss the motivations for our design decisions and provide guidance for building robust, cross-browser, cross-platform extensions. We cover several aspects of reliable extension design including background scripts, user interaction, host permissions and manifest version 2/3 in Firefox and Chrome. After this talk, you will be able to build browser extensions for Firefox, Firefox for Android, and Chrome.",

In that time, it has become one of the most used tools in Internet measurement and topology discovery. Here at Catchpoint we leverage Linux traceroute to perform measurements from nodes distributed all over the world. In order to do what we do, we've enhanced the Linux traceroute to add some useful and interesting capabilities, and made those changes publicly available. In this presentation we are going to have an overview of the enhancements we made to traceroute. These Improvements include support for QUIC, a new style of TCP traceroute called \"InSession\" aimed at bypassing firewalls, ECN bleaching detection, path MTU discovery speedup and many more. The presented enhancements are made open source with the hope that they can be helpful to the networking community.",

          "description": "IPv6-only networks are slowly becoming reality and are very well supported by mobile operating systems as well as macOS. Linux is slightly falling behind. In this talk, I will cover how IPv6-only and IPv6-mostly networks work and what needs to be done to have first class support in Linux. Let's talk about IPv6-mostly networks - the kind of networks which run IPv6-only for devices supporting it while providing some IPv4 for devices dependent on it. This can be done by DHCPv4 option called IPv6-only Preferred. Using this option, a device can opt-out from IPv4 if it does not need it for proper functionality. But even if a device opts out from IPv4, chances are it would need some IPv4-as-a-service for supporting legacy applications. Typically, 464XLAT concept is used. This relies on a client-side translator (CLAT) responsible for converting residual IPv4 into IPv6. If such a translator is missing, which is the case for the most Linux desktop distributions nowadays, most things would work normally, but chances are you will hit some corner case where your computer complains about no connectivity. There are solutions to set up CLAT on Linux but none of them is mature enough. Let's talk about what needs to be done to change this. Resources: - clatd: a CLAT daemon utilizing userspace translator TAYGA or nat46 kernel-space translator - Jool: Open Source SIIT and NAT64 for Linux - RFC 6877: 464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation - RFC 8925: IPv6-Only Preferred Option for DHCPv4 - RFC 8781: Discovering PREF64 in Router Advertisements",

          "description": "eBPF permits to run sandboxed programs in the OS kernel, mainly event-driven. It's used to extend the kernel without recompiling it or use modules. eXpress Data Path (XDP) provides a eBPF-based, high performance, programmable network data path in the Linux kernel. It provides bare metal packet processing at the lowest point in the software stack, which makes it ideal for speed. A XDP program returns an action code to tell the kernel what to do with the packet: XDP_PASS, XDP_DROP (and XDP_ABORTED), XDP_TX (and XDP_REDIRECT). This talk, after a brief introduction of what XDP is, presents how redirecting packets, using the XDP_TX return code, can be used to implement a load balancer. It shows how using Direct Server Return can increase the throughput and how to use a consistent hashing algorithm to redirect all the packets of a specific connection to the same backend server. Finally, it explores how the load balancer can be deployed directly to backend servers without the need for a dedicated machine, leveraging the Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing. The presentation of a possible network topology to deploy this load balancer using BPG or static routes completes the seminar.",

          "description": "Feel like you’re not quite sure you know about all the devices in your network? This is when network topology discovery function comes in very handy. Although, applying it might not be that straightforward if you don’t know what it consists of and how to do it. This presentation outlines the network topology discovery in detail, told by the monitoring platform’s NetXMS (netxms.com) developers team with decades of experience. They will cover such topics as - what is LLDP and CDP and how they can be used as sources of info for the topology discovery - how Spanning Tree can be such a source too (or not at all!) - what is FDB and how it can be used to get information about the end nodes in your network - automatic device discovery Finally, the NetXMS team will guide you through the network preparation guidelines, using the NetXMS use case and their hands-on experience to show you the A to Z setup process. There are many ways where you can go wrong in this process, so the team will cover also most popular pitfalls. Please, do come if your areas of interest are network monitoring, administration and architecture, if you’d like to be more efficient in your network audit — and, generally, if you are up for a great 40 minutes spent! Network topology discovery process in focus — a detailed presentation for sysadmins, network engineers, telecom integrators, and everyone interested in networks.",

          "description": "Cybersecurity attacks are constantly increasing and simple IP/port-based policies are no longer enough. GeoIP is a popular technique used to limit access to selected resources from specific locations, and IP blocklists contain lists of IP addresses that have a low reputation and for which communications (from/to) should be forbidden on healthy networks. In addition to this, IP addresses that have shown malicious behaviour (e.g. multiple service failures or WordPress attack attempts) should also be blocked. This talk introduces ipt_geofence, an open-source tool for Linux and FreeBSD that combines in one tool IP geofencing, service (e.g. SSH, Web and mail) analysis, and blocklists. It allows malicious hosts to be blocked and hence protect services in a simple way without having to use multiple tools and complex administration practices to implement what ipt_geofence offers out of the box.",

But this comes at a cost, as being further away from the silicon makes reaching high throughputs more difficult. In this talk, we will cover CPU resources management, including challenges related to CPU affinity and cgroups, and strategies to obtain better performance in network workloads at different levels of abstraction. For demonstration purposes, we will discuss network workloads deployed on Calico-VPP powered Kubernetes clusters, and the performance gains observed using CPU placement strategies.",

Included in the challenge were finding a tool to craft custom network packets, integrating the tool into the test environment and defining test cases based on the expected communication behaviors and the given firewall rules. For this it is important to know how the packet filtering in the Linux kernel is working in general. This talk will highlight how the scapy python framework works in general and how it can be used to empower developers for testing to achieve this challenge. This talk will start with an overview about the existing network packet tools and why scapy was chosen. Next it is important to understand the basics of the netfiler in the Linux kernel and how scapy is attached to it. Once a functional overview of scapy is given, we are able to write proper test cases. We will explain detailed examples how to create ICMP, UDP and TCP packets, how to manipulate the protocol header and how to choose fitting methods for sending in specific test scenarios. To wrap this up we will provide advanced real world examples based on specific iptables firewall rules.",

In this journey, he found that kernel routing at scale (many interfaces, many prefixes or many packets/sec) were better handled in userspace than server kernels (either FreeBSD or Linux). Today, Pim operates IPng Networks GmbH, a small internet provider in Zurich, Switzerland. IPng Networks is using software-based off-the-shelf PC routers which will give silicon-based routers a run for their money. In this talk, we will explore Intel's DataPlane Development Kit (https://dpdk.org), open source dataplane solutions such as VPP (https://fd.io), DANOS (https://danosproject.org), DPDK based loadtesting (https://trex-tgn.cisco.com) and discuss performance benchmarking results from the field."

          "description": "In June 2023, GÉANT announced the successful procurement of a new IP/MPLS layer for a next-generation network and the plan to automate the entire migration process using WorkflowOrchestrator (https://workfloworchestrator.org/) and Ansible with the aim to make the process quicker and at the same time more reliable and predictable. This means orchestrated service management with minimal interaction needed from the operator: no more CLI to configure network devices, all OSS and BSS systems synchronised and a flexible service modelling that accommodates the customizations and optimizations needed in a R&E environment. The adoption of a different vendor, NOKIA in our case, poses significant challenges both in terms of low-level mechanics as well as in terms of service modelling and decomposition. Now, we are sharing the results of this effort that has involved all the levels and parts of the organisation, profoundly changing our way of working. We are sure that a view into our current progress - especially considering the multi-vendor environment that we manage - will be valuable for anyone involved in the implementation and maintenance of IP networks in the community. Particular attention will be reserved to the differences between orchestration and automation, how these two topics intersect with each other in managing complex environments and how much the mindset changes in terms of design and implementation process. GAP - GÉANT Automation Platform - which now manages the new GÉANT network, is entirely based on open-source software and more specifically on the Workflow Orchestrator (created by SURF and ESnet): high-quality software written within the R&E community that works as a framework to orchestrate networks of whatever complexity and scale. GÉANT is contributing to and sustaining it to lower the barrier to adoption so that other organisations can benefit from it and join the initiative. The other cornerstone of the platform, Ansible, is an open source automation framework with a vibrant community. While not initially created for network devices, Ansible fulfils all our needs and keeps the curve of adoption low. We are eager to share how we used and misused it to achieve our needs in terms of separation between data, design and operations.",

          "description": "In order to conserve CPU cycles, it can be helpful to offload all or some of the Internet routing table, to the embedded switch within modern network cards. Linux have good support for doing this through the tc-flower(8) API, although it was originally aimed towards OVS-offloading, it's however also capable of IP forwarding. In the first part of the talk we will go through how tc-flower(8) can be used to offload IP forwarding onto a compatible SmartNIC/DPU, by scripting some tc commands. In the second part of the talk we will introduce flower-route, a new daemon, which keeps a hardware-offloaded tc ruleset in sync, with routing changes from a routing daemon like BIRD (or FRR, ...). Thereby attaining BGP-based IP forwarding offload. Our current focus is mlx5-based devices (aka. NVIDIA/Mellanox ConnectX 5+), but it will work on any other driver with support for the required offloads.",

          "description": "Zeek (formerly Bro) is an extensible and scriptable Network Security Monitor. For decades, it has provided its own custom scripting language as the primary way for users to handle low-level network protocol events. With the release of Zeek 6.0, support for JavaScript as an alternative scripting language has been added by embedding Node.js via the ZeekJS plugin. This talk will give a short Zeek introduction followed by a technical overview of how JavaScript support in Zeek was realized as an external plugin and demonstrate use-case examples. There will be details about Zeek's plugin architecture, its IO loop concepts and ways to interact with the Zeek script interpreter. Each of these enabled an almost seamless way to load .js script files, adding Node.js's libuv IO loop as another IO source into Zeek's main loop, as well as patching in JavaScript functions as Zeek event and hook handlers. Astonishingly, no modifications to Zeek's core were needed to pull this off. One area this feature opens up is Zeek interacting with external systems by using Node.js builtin functionality or off-the-shelf libraries through npm - something where the Zeek scripting language ecosystem pales in comparison or quickly requires a C++ implementation. Concrete examples are sending HTTP requests in reaction to certain events, rapid log exporter prototyping (Redis, ZeroMQ), or serving HTTP APIs directly from within Zeek.",

          "description": "k8gb is a Kubernetes native load balancing solution that enables arbitrary workloads to run in a disaster recovery mode as well as in the round robin fashion. It assumes geographically dispersed availability zones aka failure domains. Luckily, there is another open-source standard that can help with setting up such Kuberneres clusters. Cluster API is a standard that unifies Kubernetes cluster lifecycle and day-2 operations across multiple cloud providers. In this talk we will be talking about an open-source way to fully automated K8s clusters that can host workloads that can survive any failure, using pure DNS as the underlying tool for switching the communication among available Kubernetes clusters. No single vendor lock-in. Workloads can be deployed in AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem. The only common denominators are Kubernetes and Cluster-API. k8gb k8gb is DNS based global service load balancer that can interconnect multiple Kubernetes clusters into one resilient system. Join this talk to learn how it can handle a failover scenario when pods in one cluster go down and second cluster in different location saves the day. k8gb is an open-source Kubernetes operator that is deployed in each participating cluster. It is comprised of CoreDNS, ExternalDNS and the k8gb controller itself. Using ExternalDNS it can create a zone delegation on a common cloud DNS server like Route53 or Infoblox so that the embedded CoreDNS servers work as an authoritative DNS. K8gb controller makes sure these CoreDNS servers are updated accordingly based on the readiness probes of the application. In this sense this solution is unique, because it is using Kubernetes native tools with customisable probes and battle tested DNS protocol instead of HTTP pings or other similar approaches where single point of failure might be a problem. In k8gb architecture all k8s clusters are equal and there is no SPoF except the common edge DNS server. Cluster API is an umbrella standard for multiple cloud providers that can easily create new clusters using Kubernetes patterns such as controllers and custom resources. Together with k8gb it provides very nice synergy to the k8s ecosystem and also enables deploying stuff into those newly created clusters because of its hierarchical nature (parent as a management cluster & child as the workload cluster). So at the end of day we have two paradigms - k8gb representing the p2p decentralized solution while Cluster API representing the centralized architecture with single management cluster (SPoF). Believe it or not but these two above-mentioned paradigms complete each other and work together in synergy. Come to this talk and you will learn more about this setup.",

          "description": "Kubernetes has historically taken a very hands-off approach to the multi-network topic. If you’re a telecom and network jockey you know the problem: Without it, pods only have one interface. When it came to solving this in Kubernetes, rather than tackling the problem, it was left for the ecosystem to solve. Thus, projects like Multus CNI, CNI Genie and DANM came to be: they solved a community problem (“I want more than one interface in my pod!”) outside Kubernetes, following its API extension philosophy. Fast forward a bunch of years: there’s a new KEP to provide an in-tree solution to multi-networking, which will allow people to express in a Kubernetes native way that their pods require more than one network. We’re going to look at the problem from two perspectives, first a political one: What’s the community experience with working with the Kubernetes community and what kind of challenges have we faced over the years? We’ll share our stories of successes and, yes, of the failures. But because there’s only so much politics you can stomach, we’ll also look at it from the other end of the spectrum – the hands-on-a-terminal-perspective, looking directly at an implementation. Together we’ll explore architecture and API changes for Pod interfaces as Kubernetes elements, along with a prototype implementation … in Multus CNI of all things. We invite you to participate in unifying advanced networking technology in Kubernetes.",

          "description": "Since the beginning of time, declarative APIs have been driving everything that can happen inside a Kubernetes cluster. Predefined CRDs, operators defining custom CRDs, everything is about declarative APIs. Write your YAML once, deploy it, forget it. That’s how you create a cluster, that’s how you deploy your workload. But is it, for real, as simple as it sounds? How do you bring declarativeness to the imperative world? In the current state of things, host networking is one huge imperative nightmare. So how to happily marry an old-school Network Manager and brand new Kubernetes API? In this session we will demonstrate how NMState provides you with a Declarative Network API, finally allowing you to manage host networking in a declarative manner. To make it more entertaining, we will show you how the Kubernetes cluster with NMState Operator manages networking on the nodes it deploys. It may sound like a chicken and egg situation, but trust us, it is not. Last but not least, we show how it protects itself from applying destructive network changes potentially taking your cluster down. Join us and create the most complex network topologies on the fly.",

Imagine being part of a tech revolution that's ramping up, but with less drama and more practical solutions. We'll touch on quite fresh topics like containerization and eBPF technologies, and let's not overlook the L1 layer – the real powerhouse, energized by projects like FlexRAN, ARM RAL, and OpenAir Interface. Also, we'll spotlight emerging projects like Sylva and L3AF, demonstrating how they're innovating in network deployment. And here's the main course: we'll delve into where open source can truly shine, particularly in hardware-focused areas like L1, where every microsecond is an eternity and dragons in the form of proprietary algorithms and software roam. Join in for a session that's informative, straightforward, and sprinkled with a bit of fun. Let's explore how we're not just using technology, but actively evolving with it.",

          "description": "Software is eating the world, and networking is no exception. Gone are the days when there was a distinct boundary between the application servers and the networking connecting them together. In the cloud native era that we live in, much of traditional networking between applications ends up being defined entirely within the Linux kernel networking stack, sometimes enhanced by eBPF programs, to provide highly scalable and efficient connectivity between Linux containers. When network packets go missing, its no longer sufficient to capture packets with tcpdump, or trace the path through the Linux firewall rules. You may have to look deeper into the Linux kernel's networking subsystem and trace the packet flow through each of the kernel networking functions watching for packet filtering or modifications. Cilium's Packet Where aRe You (PWRU) was purpose built to help discover problems deep in the Linux kernel's network subsystem. It is a great diagnostic tool to reach for when you've ruled out DNS or an obvious firewall rule blunder. In this talk I'll review how PWRU works, and walk through a few usage examples.",

Recipes are those things we find throughout Nixpkgs and are normally targets of callPackage. We need a name for these, in order to talk about them, manage, manipulate, inherit, and organize them.

It tries to enforce purity on it's own, and has not been built around the idea that it could be used inside another build system, like... Nix! This makes it really difficult to package, and even more difficult to make it cooperate with Nix to build other packages. This talk will build upon on my experience packaging and testing Bazel 7.0.0 for nixpkgs. Going through the most interesting fixes required to make it work, we will also discuss hermeticity in both build systems, dependencies pinning with lockfiles, sandboxing, caching, remote execution and then some more. Packaging Bazel for Nix has been an intense experience, and you will get all the nice bits without the hard work !",

The intricate mechanisms in rare diseases necessitate a high level of expertise from biologists to identify potential causes. This is why it is crucial to demonstrate these results come from accurate, efficient, and reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. Indeed, accuracy is vital for patient diagnosis, efficiency is needed to handle the growing data volume and patient backlog, and reproducibility is essential to ensure the quality of the results. This talk is aimed at a diverse audience and will give feedback on Nix integration in our workflow. It will focus on how Nix significantly improved reproducibility and discuss some challenges we encountered, especially with large databases and running on high-performance computing architectures.",

          "description": "{rix} is an R package that provides functions to help you write Nix expressions: these expressions can then be used by the Nix package manager to build completely reproducible development environments. These environments can be used for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD environment. Environments built with Nix contain R and all the required packages that you need for your project: there are currently more than 80.000 pieces of software available through the Nix package manager, including the entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor packages. The Nix package manager is extremely powerful: it not only handles all the dependencies of any package extremely well, it is also possible with it to reproduce environments containing old releases of software. It is thus possible to build environments that contain R version 4.0.0 (for example) to run an old project originally developed on that version of R. With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace {renv} and Docker combined. If you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this can also be done easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via WSL2).",

            "description": "Jos joined NLnet early 2019 after having helped to start up NGI0 as a volunteer.\nHe has used and contributed to Free Software since he was at university. He first got the opportunity to work on FOSS fulltime at KO GmbH where he worked on a mobile office suite and a javascript-based editor for ODF documents called WebODF.\nHe worked on the ODF standard for the Dutch Ministry of the Interior from 2016-2018 and helped to organize ODF Plugfests to test interoperability.\nIn 2018, he pressed the Dutch Parliament to publish the source code of their Debat Direct app and sued it until the Council of State. (broncode)\nAt NLnet, Jos has reviewed and supported NGI0 projects. He designed and wrote the administration system that enables the NLnet team to handle the hundreds of proposals and projects. Since 2023, Max Crone joined the team to work on that.\nNLnet prefers to run their systems on FOSS. Jos and Ronny are currently the admin team that keeps our servers running. This involves NextCloud, Nginx, GitLab, Prosody, Dovecot, Prometheus and, very important, backups with Borg.\nWe publish part of our own code on CodeBerg. There is a strong preference for Rust."

          "description": "If you use, or want to use, full-disk encryption on your server, you might have been bothered by the problem of unattended reboots. Clevis is a decryption framework which binds secrets against a secure resource (a secure cryptographic protocol to reach a remote Tang server or a TPM) to mount the root partition. Clevis is now part of NixOS, available in the initrd and can be set up declaratively for LUKS, ZFS and Bcachefs. This talk will briefly explain the Clevis-Tang protocol and show you how to set it up on your NixOS machines.",

This diversity often hampers effective information exchange within Building Information Modeling (BIM). At the same time, it's worth noting that open-source CAD/CAM has limited options when it comes to available geometry libraries. In the latest version of IfcOpenShell, a combination of OpenCASCADE and CGAL is used to realize the best of both worlds in terms of performance, expressiveness and robustness. The presenter also uses voxelization and trees of halfspaces to cater to specific requirements. This presentation describes challenges by various disciplines in the construction sector and explores solutions by leveraging a diverse ecosystem of open-source geometry libraries and discusses the benefits and challenges of a hybrid usage of geometry libraries.",

          "description": "We live in an era where technology, especially as shipped by large companies, can be an inscrutable black box to the end user. Your smart phone arrives in your life as a fully formed slab of glass and silicon: something meant to be used, but not understood. This kind of technology diminishes users' agency and disempowers them from using the technology on their own terms. The Open Book is an open hardware e-book reader that can be built from scratch and understood, at least in broad strokes, by the average user. In this talk I'll walk through strategies that I've used when designing both the Open Book and other open hardware projects, to make objects that open themselves up not just to the developers that work on them, but to the users that work with them.",

There are a lot of enhancements for simulation during IC design: New optional matrix solver KLU enables simulating circuits with > 200k transistors and speeds-up simulation by more than 3x. Verilog-A compact device models for modern devices (FinFET etc.) are supported. Open-Source PDKs are supported (Skywater, GF, IHP, ASAP7 ...). C-code may be embedded during simulation, as well as digital Verilog (compiled with Verilator). The preferred user interface for IC design is XSCHEM. On the discrete, PCB based simulation side the user interface for embedding ngspice into KiCad has made a large jump forward when looking at 7.99 (upcoming KiCad 8). Setting up simulations has been completely revised, new ways of evaluating simulation data are available. Besides the traditional sim setpus (op, dc, tran, noise etc.) now als IBIS (interface) simulation may be used. Some simple live setups may show how to make use of this KiCad/ngspice interface.",

          "description": "What happens after a rocket achieves orbit? How does a satellite stay safe during launch and what happens after they leave their final home, right before starting their mission in orbit? The answer is revealed during this talk. PICOBUS, developed by the Libre Space Foundation, is an 8p PocketQube satellite deployer. It's a groundbreaking open-source deployer capable of storing and deploying up to 8 PocketQube Units while in orbit. The first PICOBUS deployer was manufactured to fly onboard the maiden flight of Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket, carrying two sets of QUBIK satellites, which are our very own open-source PocketQube satellites. The first launch faced a setback with an explosion shortly after liftoff, posing a threat to our deployer and satellites. However, an interesting turn of events followed! This will be discussed during this talk. The second launch attempt on October 1, 2022, was a success. PICOBUS flawlessly deployed all the satellites into space, marking a significant achievement for the open-source community. It's a rare instance of open-source technology making it to orbit, which is quite remarkable. Over the past year, Libre Space Foundation has been working on the second version of PICOBUS. This updated version is a more adaptable and lighter design, incorporating various advanced features and mechanisms to enhance its capabilities. During this talk, we will discuss all about open source in space, the open source tools used to achieve that and the difficulties faced during this journey. Our Vision is an Open and Accessible Outer Space for all. We believe that space should be claimed the libre (open source) way. Our Mission is to promote, advance and develop libre (free and open source) technologies and knowledge for space. To do that we design, develop and deliver space related projects ranging from Ground Station equipment to global monitoring Networks and of course, satellites!",

          "description": "Designing electronics is always fun, the later mass production organisation is boring and routine work, and if you do not do it properly it can easily turn into a nightmare. The different machines used in production like printers, pick and place machines, ovens, AOI, testers all run different software, different libraries, different component naming concepts. So to prepare from your KiCad project all programs to run on these machines is really time consuming. Later on the machine jobs changeovers there are also source of machine operator errors. We are dealing with electronic production for more than 30 years and we are constantly improving our process to avoid stupid mistakes and make the different machine programming easy and predictable process. KiCad scripting is nice tool to automate all this boring stuff and I will share our experience with you.",

          "description": "In the world of cloud-based software, developers enjoy the advantage of fully automated testing. Continuous Integration (CI) systems check every software update, testing every part of the software. However, this level of automated testing hasn't been easy for embedded software and devices. The main reason is their dependence on specific physical hardware, which traditionally requires manual testing by a person. This manual approach is slow and becomes more challenging as the number of device variants grows. Jumpstarter was created to help with that. It introduces a way to test embedded software automatically, just like cloud software. With Jumpstarter, we can test our software on the actual hardware it will run on, but without needing someone to manually handle the device for each test. This is a big step forward because it makes testing faster, more consistent, and less reliant on manual effort. It fits right into existing CI/CD systems like GitHub CI, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Tekton, etc.., making it easier for developers to include it in their workflow. Testing in hardware requires a testing harness to connect your hardware to Jumpstarter, as we couldn't find anything readily available and Open; this is why we also created the jumpstarter-board that allows power control and metering, storage flashing, console access, and other functions. We are working on the release 2.0.0 with additional functionality and expandability. Additionally, the Jumpstarter software is designed with a driver architecture that enables the creation of drivers for additional testing harnesses. This talk will explain how Jumpstarter makes embedded software testing easier and more efficient. We'll explain how it can save time and ensure better testing results, which is crucial for developing reliable embedded systems. We will bring the Jumpstarter board with us and share details to let you build your own or get it built for you.",

From BraillGO to Open Braille, many projects tried to produce Braille documents, with some success and some fails. In 2016 My Human Kit, a french non profit organization organize a hackathon where they start with customized 3D printer and a piece a software that translate text into Braille and Braille into GCODE. In 2017 all these poc and tests was the start of the BrailleRAP project, bringing a fully documented open source Braille embosser with accessible software. Braille embosser succesfully re-built in many countries, from Argentina to Buthan, passing by France, Belgium and Cameroun. From the first prototype in early 2018 to the lastest version in 2023, we will discuss about what failed and what was great improvments. We will focus on the documentation and assembly guide, one of the most important topic of the project. At the end we will discuss about Workshop to build BrailleRAP. In most aspect, BrailleRAP is a Fablab standard workshop, with an exception, you need a Braille reader to validate the build. And most of Braille reader are unsighted !

          "description": "Sometimes sharing a model as an STL is perfect. Sometimes you want to go parametric with FreeCAD and offer the customizability that your project needs. You can go even further and give out some code with OpenSCAD or CadQuery. Replicad is a library for web developers to build models as web apps. In this presentation I will explain why I thought I needed to build another CAD library based on the web!",

          "description": "We have developed open source hardware to make the job of setting up and running automated testing against embedded devices as quick and simple as possible. We invariably need a number of connections to hardware devices for both development and automated testing which ends up with a birds nest of wires, dongles and peripherals, we put our minds to putting all of these together in one box containing a SBC, an open source USB switch, CAN interface and an open source I/O board which includes a USB hub, serial connection, GPIO switches, optocouplers and HID emulation. This talk is about the concept, design and implementation of the Testing in a Box project along with some of the use cases that we're already using it for.",

These general approaches should be applicable to other media formats and source code from dav1d can be lifted as-is to jump start RISC-V development in other projects.",

          "description": "The recent re-architecture of GPAC yielded a simple and modular way to create dynamic media pipeline for almost all use cases related to media content handling. However, the project mainly targets statically-compiled platforms since it is written in C. The Bevara open-source project encapsulates this new GPAC architecture into the WebAssembly and Webcomponents framework in order to extend its use to browsers. This combination allows dynamic support of formats which aren’t natively supported by browsers. Our project delivers the script for integrating this new syntax in common HTML5 web pages, and additionally includes an SDK to generate new decode and playback filters and a visual studio code plugin that aids in determining the right combination of decoders for given file format. These tools leave enough room for inserting any combination of container, codec, or features in your websites to support legacy, current, or experimental media formats. This is suitable not only for novice website designers, but for professionals from the open-source community who want to ensure that content is easily accessible on all browsers.",

          "description": "GStreamer is a popular multimedia framework making it possible to create a large variety of applications dealing with audio and video. Since the last FOSDEM, it has received a lot of new features: Improved Rust support, a lot of new elements written in Rust, RTP improvements for WebRTC, new elements for hardware accelerators and more. I will go over those major improvements and explain who they can be most useful for. Finally, I'll will look forward at the next releases. GStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework that caters to a whole range of multimedia needs, whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimedia middleware; embedded systems, desktops, or server farms. It is also cross-platform and works on Linux, *BSD, Solaris, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android. This talks targets everyone who cares about Free and Open Source multimedia on embedded systems. GStreamer is the standard multimedia framework, not only on the Linux desktop, but most importantly, in embedded Linux systems.",

            "description": "Sergio Ammirata, Ph.D., grew up in Venezuela and California, then received his Ph.D. in Physics from The Ohio State University. His initial focus (in the early 2000's) was on router technology and the development of an \"appliance-like\" linux distribution which continues to this day. This platform, with the addition of streaming media technology, formed the basis for professional broadcast quality hardware equipment sales by DVEO. There, Sergio acted as CTO while continuing to run his own software company, SipRadius. Leveraging the routing background, Sergio developed and patented an error correcting protocol. DVEO marketed the proprietary technology as Dozer, and sold thousands of pieces of equipment with it. The protocol was also licensed to another vendor who incorporated it into services for major broadcast and cable companies around the world. It may safely be said that anyone who has ever watched news or sports in the U.S. has seen video transported via the Dozer protocol. Sergio was personally honored in 2016 as one of the Studio Daily Top 50 Creatives and Innovators Across the Media Industry. Among other prizes, DOZER (and Sergio personally) received a 2018 Emmy® Award for Technology and Engineering, and the Society of Broadcast Engineers Technology Award for 2014. More recently, Sergio has re-focused upon Free and Open Source Software. He maintains and is lead developer for libRIST. He continues his contributions to the VLC project. He is a Director of the Video Services Forum and an active contributor to the RIST activity group. SipRadius's development and product strategies today \"balance\" proprietary and FOSS development. It, for example, provides a \"production quality\" libRIST product in that FOSS product; it incorporates the exact same code in the proprietary Coral OS version. There, the only proprietary additions consist of a web user interface and scripting to run it. By this means, the technology remains pure FOSS and 100% accessible to developers; and the professional engineers may purchase an easier means of configuring and running it."

          "description": "With everyone being caught up with generative AI, it's probably time to look back and do something different - how can you compose music using your own creativity, and not an AI system that's a bad mimic of existing work? From methods to digitally mimic tape loops of existing sounds, akin to Steve Reich or Brian Eno, to APIs that generate MIDI files, and all the way to sound synthesis itself, we learn of many ways that music can be automatically created, either as an entire work, or part thereof. None require knowledge of musical theory, and the amount of maths needed is similarly minimal. The talk features several examples of the speakers own compositions, from https://nodemusic.com, and breaks down the process.",

          "description": "I used to edit my own podcast with COTS DAW software. Regularly, 1 hour of footage takes 6 hours' editing just to remove space, filling words, mumbles. After that, I am exhausted and couldn't do any creative arrangement. It's nearly impossible to select quotes from different speaker in different time and combine into 1 package as a independent creator in spear time, without a team. I'll share my effort to take back control of video creating, editing, and note-taking, with or without Vim. During the last two years, I wrote myself a series of handy scripts. It works with or without Vim. I cut my podcast with it, and translated podcasts into captioned videos. It's highly efficient. Yes, there are commercial products like Descript, Adobe Podcast, AVID Media Composer on the market. But it's not open nor free. Basically I defined a file format. It's basically a spreadsheet in plain text, tsv. It can be converted to and back from srt subtitle. After that, you can remove it, shuffle it, combine it or repeat it. To prove the simplicity, one can convert srt to tsv in a single line of bash: EDL stands for 'editorial decision list'. Those three letters are very useful with 'grep'. Yes. You can grep it! For example, the following line invokes ffmpeg and generates a video. Each line without 'EDL' in the beginning, will be ignored. So you get comments now. The clipname can be audio, video or still picture. You may also pipe it into tsv2fcpxml, and import into professional editing software for fine-tuning, or delegate to professional editors. So you don't have to work late side by side with them. You may even add B-roll at the head of the subtitle, to create a BBC style voice over video. Furthermore, with this plugin in Vim, you can preview video/audio with mpv player, cut/join lines, add comments and fold/unfold with Markdown/Org mode style headers. (This methodology originated from BBC is called 'Paper edit'. It's battlefield proven since 1970s and can be very efficient in news-making or news-faking.) Try it.

          "description": "The 5G Media Action Group (see www.5g-mag.com) is an international association created to foster collaboration between the media and telecom industries in technology solutions for the connected media world. One of the key activities is the 5G-MAG Reference Tools Development Programme, which was established in 2021 with multiple purposes in mind (check https://developer.5g-mag.com for all the details). Within these efforts a growing community of developers have been established around multiple projects in the domains of media transport, distribution and delivery. With projects around 5G Media Streaming, 5G Broadcast, Multicast/Broadcast, Transport protocols or eXtended Reality (XR)... developers are able to play with technology, build prototypes and demos or develop apps while providing feedback to relevant SDOs to improve the quality of both specs and code. These efforts established within 5G-MAG are fully open to the community of developers, academia and the wider industry, and aligned with the aim to foster collaboration in the complex media technologies landscape. See https://github.com/5G-MAG/Getting-Started/wiki for a complete list of projects (also on the resources attached to this entry).",

          "description": "Gephi Lite, developed by OuestWare, is a web-based, streamlined version of the renowned graph visualization tool, Gephi. Aimed at porting its features into a web application while simplifying common use cases, this project was published in 2022 (github.com/gephi/gephi-lite). The genesis of Gephi Lite is routed into academia. Over the last decade, a succession of graph visualisation and manipulation prototypes emerged, each addressing specific research requirements. These academic prototypes, funded by various research projects, paved the way for the development of increasingly powerful low-level tools (sigma.js, graphology). Gephi Lite emerges as the culmination of these efforts. This presentation explores the concise journey of how diverse research needs over the past 10 years converged into the development of Gephi Lite.",

It works by reading plain text files interconnected with [[wiki links]] and rendering them as an interactive network of index cards inside a standalone HTML file. This talk will present the design choices of Cosma, which uses existing ideas but in a peculiar way: it includes graph visualization but primarily for network synthesis rather than analysis; it creates contextualized backlinks based on wiki links but also based on citations (bibliographic references); it is a command-line program but most of its features are located within the files it exports. These choices reflect the core idea of the project (which is as much an ambition as it is a set of constraints): leveraging innovation from the “tools for thought” space (easy hypertext authoring, interactive publications) while addressing the needs of creative, investigative knowledge work (owning robust data, backing claims with sources).",

          "description": "Scripts and softwares are indispensable components of contemporary research. While the study of scientific instruments has been extensively covered in science and technology studies (STS), as well as aspects related to digital data, software strangely remains absent. I will build on the success of Jupyter computational notebooks to sketch a social study of open source scientific softwares. The Jupyter project, initiated in 2001 by a physics graduate student interested in scientific programming, has gradually evolved into a global data science infrastructure. I will demonstrate the importance of closely examining its trajectory by identifying the continually negotiated conditions for the transition from local usage to a role as a generic instrument, progressively leading to its integration into a diversity of services beyond scientific communities. The dissemination of computational notebooks has thus not only facilitated a convergence between open code and open science but also between the practices of researchers and those of computer developers, leading to the stabilization of a specific infrastructure for data analysis.",

          "description": "As researchers continue to explore the utility of platform-based large language models (LLMs) for tasks like data extraction, annotation, and classification, concerns about access, cost, scalability, volatility, and privacy arise. Even when using local or open-source LLMs in the social sciences and humanities, it is critical to address the inherent inconsistencies of LLM outputs, and to assess their suitability for specific tasks. How should LLMs be approached and evaluated for digital research projects? I propose a methodology for systematically exploring and evaluating above issues using Prompt Compass. The tool encapsulates research affordances for working with LLMs tailored to the social sciences and humanities. It provides easy access to various local and platformed LLMs, defines default (but modifiable) parameters that produce the most consistent results, offers a library of ready-made and customizable research prompts, allows for looping over rows in a CSV, and allows for testing and evaluating various LLM-prompt combinations. As technological advances reshape social science and humanities research, tools like Prompt Compass are critical in bridging the gap between LLM technologies and methodological robustness in both qualitative and quantitative research. Such tools allow for a hands-on approach to assess the stability of prompts, their accordance with specific LLMs, and the replicability of research.

          "description": "How might we innovate digital tools for citizen engagement with visual methods to ‘retool’ citizen science and invite more people to document their lived experiences as inputs to urban planning and policy? And could we do so in a participatory process that uses principles of Data Feminism and Design Justice to diversify who has a seat at the table in the tool development, and whose interest are built into the tools we make? Forged in the fire of such burning questions, we present the UB App as an open-source photovoice application for smartphones, co-created during the Urban Belonging Project (2020-22) in a process that involved scholars from Copenhagen and Amsterdam, professional urban planners, citizen engagement experts, and seven marginalized communities in Copenhagen (deaf, lgbtq+, physically disabled, mentally vulnerable, houseless, internationals, and ethnic minorities). At the 2023 FOSDEM, we are excited introduce the UB App and the UB Toolkit, and use examples from our design process to discuss the potentials and challenges of involving a multitude of voices and perspectives in the development of digital citizen science tools. We touch upon; how inputs from different stakeholders shaped decisions about what data collection the app makes possible; how it mitigates issues of privacy and visual and spatial literacy to make the app as inclusive as possible; and how design criteria were translated into app features that open new empirical opportunities for community engagement.

Drawing inspiration from the UK Reproducibility Network and various postgraduate-led initiatives nationwide, the society successfully influenced university policy, creating a supportive community for skill-sharing, motivation, and resource exchange. An initially successful project central to the society was the Monthly Mini Hacks. These were workshops that addressed the coding learning curve and promoted collaboration among students and research staff. Using Open Science Framework and open access publishing platforms, we facilitated hands-on coding experiences where information was freely available to everyone. This talk delves into the story of student collaboration, the highs and lows of open science advocacy, and the valuable lessons learned from the challenges encountered. The Surrey Reproducibility Society experienced triumph, such as university-wide implementation of policies championed by the society, and failures, including the societies eventual dissolution. This talk reflects on the society’s journey, sharing tools for attendees to implement in their own initiatives, and learn from the success and struggle of our grassroots initiative. We explore the potential for future endeavours, emphasising the importance of adaptability, community engagement, and resilience in advancing the cause of open and reproducible science within the academic landscape. We intend for attendees to leave our talk wiser than we were, inspired to make positive change, and equipped with the tools to do so.",

The book is a collaborative effort; over 470 contributors from many, diverse backgrounds share their wisdom in its pages. The size of the community means that not everyone will share the same technical skills, preferred tools, or ways of working. The book is built from Markdown source files using JupyterBook and work is largely coordinated on GitHub. We want to maintain and promote the benefits of version control, plain text and open working. However, this can clash with the experience and expectations of collaborators, raising the barrier to contribution and potentially making people feel unwelcome. I will talk from my perspective as an RSE and co-lead of The Turing Way's infrastructure working group about lessons in bridging the knowledge of our community and the technology of how the book is produced.",

A typical workshop uses several online components: a website with course notes, an etherpad for shared notes, data downloads, Github repositories and frequently a Jupyter notebook or Rstudio server. One of the popular lessons is HPC Carpentry which covers an introduction to the Unix command line and using shared High Performance Computing systems. CarpentriesOffline (https://carpentriesoffline.org) is an out of the box solution for running a Carpentries workshop from a single device such as a Raspberry Pi, old laptop or even a dedicated server. It is intended for use in environments where there is limited or no internet access. Everything needed to run the workshop including course notes, data files, software downloads, a Git server, etherpad and a Jupyter Hub server are provided by the CarpentriesOffline system. It can also provide a backup environment for those with better connectivity in the event of the Carpentries website, etherpad, GitHub etc suffering an outage. We have also developed a miniature high performance computing system based around the Raspberry Pi and RockPi single board computers to allow participants to experience using a high performance computing system without having remote access to one.

          "description": "Infra Finder is a new tool for advocates, decision-makers, and creators in the open infrastructure space. It is open-source and free to use. In this first release in January 2024, Infra Finder contains a standard set of information about 56 open infrastructure tools and services enabling the sharing of research data and publications that audiences can use to identify services, increase adoption, and foster development and investment in open infrastructure. At Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI, https://investinopen.org/), we are committed to iteratively developing Infra Finder with the community. In the past months, through user interviews, focus groups, and testing, we acquired a better understanding of libraries’ and institutions’ infrastructure discovery and evaluation processes. We refined our interface design and data collection and validation workflows to be able to provide up-to-date, validated information in one place, and offer at-a-glance comparison views, with links to more granular information, thereby saving librarians time and effort in looking for scattered pieces of information to discover and evaluate what’s on offer. (More in our latest blog post: https://investinopen.org/blog/blog-introducing-infra-finder/) With this first release, we are collecting feedback and use cases for this first set of services in Infra Finder in order to further develop the information resource and the set of services covered in the tool. In this session, we will demonstrate Infra Finder. We will also share information about expressing interest in adding your tool to Infra Finder, and invitations for audience feedback and suggestions on the current iteration as we develop our next steps for expansion of the tool.",

          "description": "Much of the existing research about open source elects to study software repositories instead of ecosystems. An open source repository most often refers to the artifacts recorded in a version control system and occasionally includes interactions around the repository itself. An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source. This talk provides guidelines and best practices for research using data collected from open source ecosystems, encouraging research teams to work with communities in respectful ways.",

The simple objective was to make high quality data management easier for researchers. This presentation will explore the real needs that researchers have from data management, before moving on to how the PHAIDRA project (https://phaidra.org/community/phaidra-partners/) has been built to address these needs. We will look at the challenges and lessons (still being) learned after 15 years of running a collaborative project in the space and end with a vision of how open source, open standards and, above all, community offer the only workable solution for both Open Research and the long-term preservation of research data and digital assets.",

          "description": "In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Meta has taken steps to enhance transparency within its advertising network, notably through the Ads Library web portal and the API endpoint Ads Archive. Despite these initiatives, and potentially due to underutilization by the public and journalists, instances of exploitation endure on Facebook and Instagram. A recent illustration of this is the extensive RRN operation in 2023, involving hundreds of thousands of fake pages and advertisements 1 2. This presentation aims to offer practical insights into navigating the API, highlighting current limitations and proposing effective workarounds. A key focus will be on Facebook’s categorization of “Social Issues, Elections or Politics.” Indeed, applying this label to an ad has two consequences : (1) heightened scrutiny by Meta moderation and (2) increased public accessibility to data such as cost and targeted audience. Deliberate mislabeling then becomes a standard modus operandi in foreign information manipulation and interference. This presentation will detail ongoing efforts to detect and quantify the prevalence of mislabeled ads using open semantic and network analysis libraries.",

          "description": "Embark on a journey into the intricacies of social sciences research, exploring the fusion of different platforms for a single project. Drawing from my hands-on experience in my Communication studies master's thesis, \"Visualization of a hypertextual interaction field in the form of a network using computational processes. Case study: Graffiti on freight trains in North America\", this presentation shares the challenges faced by social science students in developing robust programming projects without prior tech expertise. It underscores the pivotal role of open source tools, and community, in overcoming these challenges, shedding light on the logical links facilitated by adaptable programming projects. This allows the integration between platforms and the possibility of creating logical connections between data and theoretical-methodological aspirations. The synergy of spaCy, TensorFlow, Instagrapi, Graphology, and SigmaJS exemplifies the potential of open-source software. The presentation explores intricate adjustments made to spaCy, such as hashtag neutralization and graffiti entity identification without Named Entity Recognition (NER). It also examines the significance of custom object detection models in TensorFlow. The talk emphasizes the decision-making flexibility within Graphology/SigmaJS for network construction and visualization, with a focus on \"reduction by inference\" as a clear outcome resulting from the amalgamation of theoretical perspectives and different programming libraries or platforms. In conclusion, the interplay between TensorFlow or spaCy, model inference in Python, the role of SQL as a link between platforms, and network formation with PHP to Graphology syntax, culminating in visualization with SigmaJS in JavaScript, underscores the significance of open-source tools. \"Reduction by inference\" emerges as a crucial aspect for identifying symbolic elements in social phenomena, exemplified by graffiti on freight trains. This achievement is made possible only through open-source tools and their potential for linkage through \"data\".",

          "description": "Quantum Computing is an exciting field of research that is in the process of growing out of academic labs and trickling into both public discourse and general use -- and before that, towards the use of researchers from other fields. One of the main blockers is the difficult realisation of physical devices that permit such computing. Step by step, this blocker is being resolved and real quantum hardware becomes accessible to users through cloud services. Another is making the paradigm sufficiently accessible that users without expert knowledge of the underlying physics can consider developing algorithms that take advantage of quantum hardware. Qadence (https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence/) is a recent open-source project designed to help users develop digital-analog quantum programs. It features tools both for designing such programs, visualizing them and simulating results before getting access to quantum hardware. This presentation will talk you through the design, implementation and test of a simple algorithm using Qadence. It does not assume knowledge of quantum physics, quantum computing fundamentals, or the definition of digital-analog quantum computing. Some knowledge of Python will be helpful.",

          "description": "Workflow management tools have long been used in scientific computing to organise and operate workflows. Many such tools, e.g., Snakemake, Luigi, and Toil, have grown from the foundation of Make (wherein users define simple rules with interdependent inputs and outputs), incorporating additional features to suit increasingly complex user needs. Initially seeing a widespread uptake in bioinformatics, workflow managers have become commonplace in many fields, for example, high-energy physics (HEP). Analyses in HEP typically consist of many non-trivially related processes with widely varying requirements. Workflow managers can vastly simplify such analyses, providing user-friendly methods to define, review and run analysis workflows. Snakemake has emerged as a leading workflow manager for HEP, with an established user base spread across major experiments. Dialogue between developers and HEP has led to integrations for distributed storage/transfer frameworks, e.g., XRootD, FTP and Amazon S3, and scheduling frameworks, e.g., HTCondor, Slurm, and DRMAA. These integrations enable analysts to better leverage the distributed computing resources made available by experiments, significantly improving the efficiency of HEP analyses. Further collaboration between analysts and developers has seen Snakemake form the core of several standardised analysis frameworks aimed at improving analysis reproducibility such as REANA. This contribution discusses the current use of workflow managers in HEP, including best practices for their application. Additionally, the anticipated requirements of analysts are considered within the context of ever-increasing data scales in HEP.",

          "description": "A robust, miniaturized and open-source version of an electrostatic fieldmeter sensor, the MiniMill, is presented. The sensor is designed for a fast-response detection of the atmospheric electric field strength, an intrinsic parameter of the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) that electrically links the Earth’s surface to the upper levels of the atmosphere. Such a field varies greatly with the various weather conditions due to the re-distribution of charged or uncharged aerosols and terrestrial radioactive particles. Field mill electrometers have been consecutively used for ground-based measurements of such fields under diverse conditions, but sparse iterations of the sensor exist that can be tethered to airborne measurement platforms. The lightweight, disposable and easily reproducible design of the MiniMill allows the use on agile platforms, such as weather balloons, UAVs or even campaign aircrafts, and achieves a measurement accuracy of a few V m-1 on DC fields. MiniMill performance has been tested in vertical profiling measurements during scientific experiments in 2019 and 2022, where sensor “constellations” were launched on-board meteorological radiosondes under both fair weather conditions and large tropospheric dust events originating from the Sahara Desert. The sensor’s response exhibits a clear influence to the vertical large scale electric field when charged dust particles are present in the atmospheric circulation, which is a significant research achievement. Also, we would like to share the inherent challenges of such a sensor (or, you know, lots of sensors) implemented entirely within the academic and research community. Let's brainstorm ways to make these sensors even more awesome together!",

The visual and usability paradigms that were the golden standards when the first version of Thunderbird was released are looked at like today we look at carts and horses as the fastest means of transportation. When Thunderbird was first released, tabs weren’t even a thing. Can you imagine using your OS without tabs at all? This talk will explore the years of UI evolution (and stagnation) of Thunderbird, and explain the reasons that drove us to the decision of reworking it entirely from scratch, which modern UI/UX we’re implementing, what challenges are we facing, and how our community is responding to this drastic “life shattering” event.",

But if you use the command line, you would most certainly benefit from using a good prompt system instead of the default one, because it will help you make sense of the state of your workflow. Among modern prompt systems, Liquid Prompt is the older one, surely the one with the best feature set, and probably the one having thought the most of about its design. This presentation will introduce the why and how of the \"Dotmatrix\" theme for Liquid Prompt, which drastically rethink how information is displayed to the user. It will discuss the impact on UX of accessibility, the ANSI color space, information significance and text-oriented visual grammar(s).",

          "description": "There's little love for design and UX in many security-related FOSS projects. After all, why should anyone care about the looks of something created (mostly) for expert users? As long as it works, the user interface is not really important, isn’t it? Designers will often answer with indignation, appeal to possible wider audiences, or just give up on arguing with the hackers. However, bad UX is bad not just for the so-called \"normal people\". Even the experts are human, and as humans are susceptible to cognitive biases and mistakes; and while privacy and security are great, they are even better when available widely and comfortably, so that their users are not obviously recognizable as \"people with something to hide\". For the last several years, I have been working on improving the UX of Qubes OS, a security-focused operating system. In this talk, I will share the insights this work brought me on how improving UX can lead to better security, discuss how user research methods can be used to improve not just the feel of the software, but also its security, and discuss insights from cognitive psychology that can help us create more secure designs.

          "description": "This talk will share insights on interdisciplinary approaches for inclusive design that enhances the navigation capacity for people with disabilities. We explore disciplines that provide language support, privacy, data protection, security, and safety for the disability community. This talk relates to everyone involved in the design of digital technologies which includes standards, policies, applications, and more. Technology designers from different disciplines are increasingly confronted with the topic of accessibility for people with disabilities, yet are often unsure how to approach it. Sensitivities often prevent efficient interaction among designers from different disciplines. This workshop is open to all - designers, developers, digital rights activists, usability consultants, and accessibility consultants. One does not require specific expertise to participate. People with backgrounds in collecting feedback from users and open-source tool teams who have integrated and implemented usability and accessibility improvements based on user feedback are welcome. The talk will share best practices and resources that comply with accessibility best practices and how one can achieve the desirable accessibility standard. The talk will also share the results or examples of feedback collected from people with disabilities, outlining specific gaps in the accessibility of current open-source tools such as BigBlueButton, Jitsi, RiseUp Pad, Crypto Pad, Tella, Destiny, CDR Link, Círculo, etc. Participants will have a Participants will also have a 1) Comprehensive understanding of the accessibility status of popular open-source tools by learning about the common accessibility myths. 2) Understand the dire need for adopting accessibility standards to foster digital inclusion for people with disabilities. 3) The socio-economic benefits of making privacy and security tools more accessible by incorporating principles of web-accessibility.",

          "title": "Standardizing the generation and signing of boot images",
          "description": "Abstract This presentation will talk about how SoCs can leverage Binman to simplify the overall boot-loader build flow. We use Texas Instruments (TI) K3 family of SoCs as an example, which, like many other SoCs today, use custom tools to build and sign their boot-loader binaries. However, U-Boot contains a powerful and flexible packaging tool Binman and this can be extended to sign and package even complex boot-loader images. The session outlines the challenges in maintaining and shipping custom tools for any sort of build, highlighting its limitations in scaling, maintaining consistency and accommodating evolving system requirements. This presentation shows the effort in leveraging Binman, moving towards a completely open-source solution that also simplifies the build using K3 devices as an example. We also aim to present how we can make Binman the standard when it comes to the developing boot-loaders for any OS. A few platforms such as Kontron i.MX8M and Renesas RZ/N1 already use Binman to package their boot-loader binaries but we see that there is a larger scope of pulling all platform packaging to the standard. Description The boot loader images involved in booting a TI K3 device to Linux are: - tiboot3.bin: containing SPL (Secondary Program Loader) for the R5 core, may include system firmware for certain devices - sysfw.itb: containing system firmware and board configuration binaries - u-boot.img: containing the U-Boot image that can load the final Linux kernel image In addition to the complexity of the K3 boot flow, each boot-loader image is packaged differently according to the whether the device: - is a High-Security Field Securable (HS-FS), High-Security Enforced (HS-SE) or General Purpose (GP) - follows Combined or Legacy boot flow - contains system firmware (SYSFW) split into Texas Instruments Foundational Security (TIFS) and Device Manager (DM) or not split This leads to four similar yet unique boot flows. Since the image must account for a combination of the three choices, packaging the boot-loader is a complex process that involves signing as well. This was earlier achieved using TI custom solution repositories, k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3. k3-image-gen was responsible for generating and packaging board configuration data and system firmware binaries into tiboot3.bin or sysfw.itb while core-secdev-k3 was used for signing the required binaries in the case of HS devices. The flow looked like this. The upstreaming effort proposed a flow that embedded the functionalities of k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3 using Binman shown here. Now by migrating the boot-loader generation to Binman, complex shell scripts that stitched boot images together are no longer needed. Instead, the generation is standardized to creation using the binman node in the DTS, for example: tiboot3 { filename = \"tiboot3.bin\"; ti-secure-rom { content = <&u_boot_spl>, <fw1>, <fw2> ...; keyfile = \"key.pem\"; load = <LOAD_ADDR>; load-fw1 = <LOAD_ADDR_FW1>; load-fw2 = <LOAD_ADDR_FW2>; ... }; u_boot_spl: u-boot-spl { }; fw1: fw1 { filename = fw1.bin; }; fw2: fw2 { filename = fw2.bin; }; ... }; An example of a proper application of the Binman node for K3 devices can be seen here. You can view the entire patch series that was submitted and has been accepted in the resources or here. This presentation will provide an overview of the tool, understanding how to migrate your custom tools and platforms to Binman with K3 as an example and finally discuss current challenges and limitations while expanding to other platforms in U-Boot. Attendees will obtain insights into a practical implementation of Binman, its integration within existing workflows and best practices to leverage this tool to optimize U-Boot boot-loader development.",

          "description": "There was a time when we were happy and care free, and booting our computers off a floppy disk found behind the pub down the road was an exciting and joyful adventure. Alas, those days are past now. Significant effort and investment have gone into securing the boot process of a general purpose PC, and we are nowhere near done. Linux is trailing significantly behind Windows and MacOS in this regard, and we have a long way to go. With TPM support in UKIs, systemd-stub and systemd-boot, the systemd project is trying to do its part in bringing the ecosystem forward. But we need to talk about the kernel command line. Decades of [over|ab]use have made it into a kitchen sink, used to do anything and everything, and (custom) parsed by everything and anything, including the kernel before ExitBootServices() has been called. The surface attack that opens up for an authenticated writer is unfathomable, and the magnitude of a successful exploitation is simply unknowable. Is it time for the kernel command line to end? This talk will explore alternatives to let users configure early initrd/userspace services provided by the systemd project, and plead with anybody willing to listen to start using those instead: UKIs, signed addons for UKIs, signed Confext/Sysext images, systemd credentials, SMBIOS Type 11 strings, bootconfig.",

          "description": "Following the agreement reached in early December 2023, and pending formal approval by both the European Parliament and the Council, the CRA will be adopted shortly. What's going to happen next? The EU Commission will issue a standardization request to European standardization organizations to develop multiple technical standards (about 40!) defining how to apply the requirements of the CRA. As usual, the devil is in the details, and these standards will substantially shape the future of software in Europe, and as a result, of open source. The problem? The EU standardization organizations which will be tasked with developing those standards (CEN-CENELEC and ETSI) are very formal structures that are as arcane and antithetical to open source communities as the EU legislative process itself was only a few months ago. There's a very serious risk that this upcoming standardization process might happen again with little or no consultation of the impacted open source communities and lead to additional harm as a result, further damaging Europe’s standing in the open source community and its ability to host, foster, contribute to, and leverage open source projects essential to its sovereignty. The goal of this session is to preempt this scenario by proactively engaging with policy makers and carving out a path forward that leads to better outcomes for both Europe and open source.",

He's been an occasional conference speaker on community topics, a participant and twice organizer of the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS – the yearly summit for coordinating and solving issues around Perl and CPAN ecosystems and supply chain tooling), and a founding member and long-time contributor in Oslo Perl Mongers.\nHe is also a founding member of the CPAN Security Working Group, which was created specifically as a consequence of him introducing NIS2 and CRA to the PTS in April, 2023.\nLately, Salve has spent his volunteering time budget on figuring out what kind of mess he's stumbled into (SBOMs and EU laws) by talking with lots of humans and one cat. He sometimes wishes more people cared about the consequences of their actions (or inactions) on Open Source volunteers."

This will be an example-driven tour of practical ways to introduce concurrency to your scripts by using Raku's asynchronous capabilities for every day situations. We will cover built-in language features like promises, supplies, channels, threads, atomic variables, reactive event loops, and asynchronous processes. We'll also touch on advanced concurrent techniques using modules from the Raku ecosystem.",

Although the default isolation level in most databases is usually adequate, it is important to know and use it correctly in your application. This technical session explores the implementation of these concepts in popular SQL databases such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and YugabyteDB. We will also examine why traditional SQL standard definitions may not be suitable for MVCC databases and why this knowledge is essential for developers. By the end of the session, you will be able to navigate these subtleties with ease and make informed decisions in your application design without getting too academic.",

As the popularity and adoption of PostgreSQL continues to grow, the interaction of roles, privileges, and object ownership is a recurring theme of confusion in forums and mailing lists. In this session, I’ll start by defining the Principle of Least Privileges and how this philosophy influences roles and privileges in PostgreSQL. Next, I’ll demonstrate the importance of object ownership in PostgreSQL, how group and user roles can work in unison to effectively manage permissions, multiple ways to manage default privileges, and which privileges should always be modified in any new PostgreSQL database. Finally, I’ll discuss how recent releases are laying a foundation for more flexible and robust security management in the years ahead. By the end of this session, you will understand how roles work in PostgreSQL, how they impact your daily work, and how to effectively communicate security best practices with others on your team. You’ll leave with a solid information to start creating roles that effectively manage access to your cluster and data.",

The task seems to fall more and more often to people whose expertise lies in other areas, such as systems administrators. I've noticed this particularly in organisations where everything’s running on Kubernetes, and the databases are seen as just another part of that landscape. If you're in this situation, what do you do? Go out and learn to be a database administrator? Hope the databases will look after themselves? Panic? A better option would probably be to implement one of the Kubernetes operators that have been created by database experts. The Operator not only knows how to do database administration but also how the database components interact with Kubernetes to get the most out of its features. It will automate everything from deployment of a high availability database environment to backup and recovery, monitoring and even upgrades. Let’s have a look at what a Kubernetes database operator can do for you and what you need to look for when choosing one.",

She liked them so much that she became a Senior Database Consultant and then a Senior Solutions Architect working exclusively with PostgreSQL. She was once described as “quite personable for a DBA” which she decided to take as a compliment. Outside of the world of databases she loves cycling, mountain biking, skiing and spending time with her family in the mountains where she lives."

          "description": "Postgres heavily relies on various parts of the operating system - filesystem and buffered i/O are good examples of such fundamental dependencies. But there are many commonly used filesystems supported by Linux, from traditional ones (ext4,xfs) to modern ones (zfs, btrfs) and various exotic ones. The question is - are there significant performance differences between these filesystems for Postgres? Are there clear winners or filesystems you definitely should not use? I did a similar comparison a couple years back, but both the Postgres and kernel are continuously improving and adopting to new hardware, so let's look at fresh data.",

          "description": "Historically it has been able to find MySQL DBAs than their PostgreSQL counterparts. The growth in PostgreSQL has increased the demand for new DBAs. So why not convert some MySQL DBAs into competent PostgreSQL DBAs? This session covers where you need to concentrate on guiding this conversion. There are many similarities between the two RDMS but this session covers where the 'pinch points' are that will require guidance. Starting with setting up a basic instance for the conversion candidates with a familiar-ish training database, we will proceed into differences in MVCC, Indexing, TOAST, and other divergent areas. You can very quickly have a new PostgreSQL DBA that you have built yourself.",

Initiated in 2015 through a collaborative effort between Ruby for Good and the Portland Diaper Bank, this Digital Public Good (DPG) has achieved remarkable growth without employing any paid staff. Expanding its reach to hundreds of essentials banks and thousands of nonprofit partners across North America, human-essentials now plays a crucial role in supporting over 3 million children and 500,000 period supply recipients annually. Remarkably, this success has been driven by the contributions of nearly 300 volunteers. Join us to uncover the secrets behind this project’s success. Learn about the innovative strategies and community-driven approaches that have enabled human-essentials to defy expectations and thrive as a sustainable open source software project.",

E.g., Germany's initiative to build an open office and collaboration platform (openDesk) has made great progress, the German developer portal (docs.fitko.de) got an upgrade and Germany developed standard contractual clauses for public sector open source projects (EVB-IT). I would like to give a brief summary of this progress and would like to motivate to better organize our knowledge about foss in public administration.",

          "description": "Medical imaging plays a crucial role in modern healthcare, enabling accurate diagnoses and effective treatment planning. However, the management and accessibility of vast amounts of imaging data present significant challenges. Orthanc, a free and open-source, lightweight, and extensible software, has emerged as a recognized solution for medical imaging data management. Orthanc serves as a vendor-neutral archive, facilitating the cost-effective storage, retrieval, and sharing of various imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, CT scans, and more. Its modular design allows seamless integration into existing healthcare systems. Orthanc's compliance with the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and DICOMweb interoperability standards ensures compatibility across different imaging devices and platforms, fostering collaborative research and multidisciplinary healthcare approaches. Key features of Orthanc include its user-friendly interface, scalability, and support for advanced functionalities like de-identification and encryption, ensuring patient data security and privacy compliance. Multiple Web viewers are integrated into Orthanc, such as OHIF, Kitware VolView, and the Stone Web viewer. Orthanc also comes with a REST API that can be used to script imaging workflows, which is widely used to set up auto-routing between local DICOM servers or between remote sites. Furthermore, its ability to incorporate machine learning algorithms for image analysis and processing opens avenues for automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and research advancements. Digital Public Goods Alliance recognized Orthanc as a digital public good in August 2023. This underscores the commitment of the Orthanc community to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 9 (health, innovation, infrastructure). In conclusion, Orthanc stands as a robust, versatile, and adaptable software solution for the efficient management and utilization of medical imaging data. Its accessibility, interoperability, and capacity for customization position Orthanc as a valuable asset in advancing medical research, clinical workflows, and ultimately improving patient care outcomes.

          "description": "There is an increasing trend of packaging and sharing tools in the epidemiology research community. But these tools remain difficult to use and to integrate in a data analysis pipeline. There is a need for a more integrated approach, ensuring that the various tools work well with one another. For example, minimal data wrangling should be needed to transform the output of one tool before passing it to the next tool down the data analysis pipeline. Similarly, various alternatives for a single step of the pipeline should as much as possible use the same inputs and return the same outputs. In this talk, I will present how the Epiverse-TRACE project collaborates with many R package developers in epidemiology to integrate their tools in a unified universe. Indeed, the unique and challenging feature of Epiverse is that it doesn’t intend to create a unified universe from scratch, but instead aims at updating existing external pieces of software to better work together. This talk will explain how we identify the key parts that should be updated, and how we make these updates with minimal disruption to the individual package developers and established community of users.",

          "description": "The French government agency ANCT recently started using the open-source collaborative spreadsheet Grist, with so far a great positive feedback from users. As the needs grow, ANCT now hires people to contributes to the product either as developers or as designers, not only for their own benefits but also for the greater community. We'll talk about our use cases, what is Grist and why we chose it and refused to fork, how tightly we collaborate with the editor behind the product, and what are our prospects for the future.",

          "description": "Janssen Project is a Linux Foundation sub-chartered project that publishes a government-class federated identity infrastructure stack. The software was registered as a DPG in 2023. Federated identity is probably the most urgent requirement for the success of the 50-in-5 initiative. Many DPG members say \"infrastructure\" when they currently mean \"identity infrastructure\". While MOSIP is useful for citizen registration and identity lifecycle management, it is not an enterprise class Authentication and Authorization platform. The need for authentication/authorization infrastructure like Janssen is articulated in the Govstack architecture, which specifies the need for \"a mechanism... [to provide] the appropriate level of access to the various building blocks by different users and organizations.\" Janssen is not one piece of software--it's a cloud deployment strategy for several open source components deployed as one unit. Potentially, MOSIP could be incorporated as a Janssen component. This talk will discuss the features and architecture of Janssen and explain why it is critical for the success of the DPG initiative.",

We know that digital solutions have been growing exponentially, and so has their environmental footprint. The internet has led to a great deal of this growth, and this has gone in-step with the growth in open source software. There are a number of new initiatives to help track the environmental impact of our digital world. Even better, there are a several that have been actively developed which are under a permissive license. More is needed though to ensure that public code is being built in a way which does not contribute to climate change.

          "description": "Thanks to EU and French state founding, SNCF Réseau, the French Railway Infrastructure Manager start to develop an open source project (www.osrd.fr) with 40 peoples. But SNCF Réseau's challenge is to keep pace with the decarbonization of transport, and thus ensure more traffic, by optimizing infrastructure investments. If we want to be competitive with air and road, we need to have the most efficient railway system. These investments require long studies, simulation tool to design the right infrastructure delivering the expected services. This challenge is shared by all the infrastructure managers and the tools different and closed. We decided to propose a commun tool to improve the quality of the studies and the transparency of the usage of public money both for the software and the infrastructure. Collaboration with other infrastructure manager around OSRD is already planned to add value in the software but also in the business. Here is our Github: https://github.com/osrd-project",

          "description": "This talk focuses on the synergistic combination of CrateDB (https://github.com/crate/crate) and LangChain (https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): it helps to get started with using private data as context for large language models through LangChain, incorporating the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). CrateDB as an open-source distributed SQL database helps to streamline data management by supporting a wide variety of data models ranging from documents over time series and full-text search towards recently added support for vectors and similarity search. Thus, it helps to avoid technology sprawl in modern data architectures that need to cope with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data while not sacrificing the convenience of having a standard SQL interface. LangChain, an open-source framework written in Python, is specifically designed to facilitate the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). LangChain enables seamless integration of language models with various data sources and services, acting as a bridge between AI language capabilities and private data. During the talk we will demonstrate CrateDB's proficiency in storing and handling vector data, and how this can be utilized by large language models (LLMs) through LangChain, further enhanced by RAG for richer contextual insights. Through live coding demonstration, we will illustrate firsthand the process of extracting data from CrateDB and integrating it into LLMs using LangChain, thereby enriching language models with new data. This integration finds practical applications in semantic search, content recommendation, and data analytics, just to name a few. The talk will appeal to anyone keen on leveraging Large Language Models, enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation, to unlock new insights from their private data. Participants will also learn how to leverage the CrateDB database to efficiently store vector data and utilize vector search in advanced analytics applications.",

          "description": "Lea is a Python module helping to calculate probabilities on situations presenting uncertainties. It is meant to be open, intuitive, and easy. Lea can deal with discrete variables, interdependent events, conditional probabilities, probabilistic programming (PP) and many more. Unlike most of other probability toolkits, it is open to different probability representations, including fractions and symbols (using the SymPy library). These features make Lea ideal for education, to learn the theory of probability, from basics to advanced concepts. The talk will present classical or non-classical problems in probability, and how these can be solved easily using Python and Lea. These include games (dice roll, RPG combats, etc.) and funny paradoxes (non-transitive dice, boy or girl paradox, etc.). The “murder party” case will demonstrate how uncertain information can help to find out the most probable perpetrator of a murder. These examples will switch between probabilities as float numbers, fractions and symbols, i.e. returning formulas instead of numbers—and demonstrating practically Python’s “duck typing” at work. The talk will conclude with a revival of the “bullshit generator”, a 15 years-old, non-serious precursor of ChatGPT (300 lines script, including data)!",

          "description": "Efficient and well managed Orchestrating your Data processing Pipelines is crucial to provide the back-bone of the modern Data processing needs. With all the new rage of LLMS and AI, it's more important than ever to make sure that you can wrap your head around all the old, new and upcoming data processing tools and services you use, but also track the provenance, lineage of the data, and make it easy to author and mange those for distributed teams. This talk will bring to the light how modern Airflow 2.7+ provides proven and also modernised, easy nd nice to use ways on how to do it. Quite often you hear about the \"new\" orchestrator that aims to solve your orchestration needs. You can also often hear how it compares to Airlfow. However those comparisions often overlook the fact that since Airflow 2.0 has been introduced, it continues to evolve and piece-by-piece modernize itself and respond to the needs of processing even more data, and interacting with even more systems that were not even existing a year ago (think LLMs) - while continue harnessing the powers of other tools you already used in the past and bind them all together. New UI, New ways of writing your orchestration tasks, new ways to test them, tracking lineage, simpler authoring and intracting with object storages. And the comparision often overlook that if you start your journey with Airflow today, your experience will be quite a bit different than even 2 years ago (what usually most comparisions talk about). This talk will highlight some of the important ones. Also you might be surprised but this is all happening without breaking compatibility - hence you can still you use it in the \"old way\". But maybe it's time to learn new ways?",

          "description": "The AlekSIS® project, a free and open school information system helping with digitisation of school organisation, originally had a frontend based on the server rendered Django template engine as a reliable and easy solution. As our frontends got more complex and we had to built interactive components like a timetable builder, we ran into limits of this system. In addition to that, the UI framework we had been using got out of support. So we decided to develop a completely new frontend as a single page application based on Vue.js and the UI framework Vuetify, connecting to the Django backend using a GraphQL API. But because of our large, modular ecosystem with many different apps, we knew we never would be able to migrate everything to the new frontend within one release. Therefore, the team faced the challenge to integrate pages with the old frontend together with new pages in the new single page application. The core of this system is an abstraction layer that allows daisy chaining the Vuetify views with server-rendered pages, including sugar that lets legacy Django pages communicate with the client-side UI framework. We would like to share our experiences about this complex migration and what problems to expect and how we solved them. (Allergen declaration: May contain traces of JavaScript.)",

There are over 400,000 Python packages on Python Package Index (PyPI) and many more on other registries like conda-forge, mostly for scientific libraries. Making sure this and the wider Python ecosystem are secure is a huge job and requires consistent contributions. Thanks to OpenSSF’s Alpha-Omega project and AWS, we now have a PSF Security Developer-in-Residence and PyPI Safety & Security Engineer whose responsibility includes a security audit of the PyPI codebase and infrastructure, improving security practices, and establishing metrics on security posture to show the impact. In this talk, Cheuk will go over the work that has been done by the PSF security team and what the best practices for Python library maintainers and users are.",

PEP 593 – Flexible function and variable annotations introduced a new concept of \"annotations\" which, in contrast with most other type hints, can be used at runtime for more generic purposes by simply attaching context-specific metadata to (typed) objects. In this talk, we will first present the concepts behind Annotated, introduced in the standard library with Python 3.9, perhaps as the first type hint to cross the runtime frontier. We'll then explore how this pattern has been increasingly embraced by third-parties libraries, many of which in the topic of data modelling and validation (such as the famous Pydantic), to provide nicer APIs to developers with improved composability, reduced boilerplate and better extensibility. Finally, we'll illustrate how to apply this pattern in a few take-away use cases in order to hopefully demystify Annotated to casual Python programmers as well as extend the horizon of more seasoned hackers, already familiar with meta-programming patterns.",

This talk introduces a groundbreaking approach to profiling Python applications using eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter), a technology traditionally associated with systems-level monitoring. Python, known for its simplicity and versatility, is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. However, profiling Python applications, especially in production environments, poses unique challenges due to its interpreted nature and dynamic runtime behavior. In this session, I will share insights from my recent work on integrating Python profiling support into Parca, an open-source project for continuous profiling. I will delve into the complexities of profiling interpreted languages like Python and how eBPF can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. The talk will cover: Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of eBPF's potential in application-level profiling and practical knowledge to apply these techniques to their Python projects.",

          "description": "Libervia is a versatile XMPP client with multiple frontends, developed using Python. The web frontend, inclusive of browser code, is uniquely crafted in Python, leveraging Brython. In this talk, I will delve into Brython's essentials – a Python implementation in JavaScript. I'll discuss the rationale behind choosing Brython and demonstrate its application in enabling functionalities like instant messaging, blogging/social networking, video calling, and so on. Utilizing Brython facilitates code reuse across backend and frontend, eliminating the need for language and context switching. This approach significantly enhances overall development efficiency. Furthermore, employing Python in the browser, as enabled by Brython, introduces exciting possibilities. It simplifies the development process and broadens the scope for innovative features and interactions within web applications.",

            "description": "I am the lead for the Managed Runtimes and System Libraries team at Rivos, a RISC-V hardware focused company. I contribute to many projects to make sure they are well supported on RISC-V. I’m also the lead for the Language Runtimes working group at RISE (learn more on all the projects we are contributing to).\nI previously worked at Datadog leading the Java Profiler product, contributing to many APM related projects, and pushing forward the state of serviceability in the OpenJDK project.\nI also worked as a software engineer in the Java Engineering Group at Microsoft. I worked on everything related to OpenJDK, and my later focus was porting the OpenJDK on Windows-AArch64 and macOS-AArch64.\nI joined Xamarin in March 2014, then Microsoft, in March 2016, through Xamarin’s acquisition. During my time at Xamarin, I worked on the Mono Runtime and its integration to the various Xamarin products (Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, VS for Mac). After a short stint in the .NET team from March 2019 to May 2019, I joined the Java Engineering Group in May 2019.\nOver these experiences, I worked on a broad range of runtime related technologies, from GC to compilers (JIT and AOT), to integration to many platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, PS4, Xbox, WebAssembly), architectures (x86, aarch64, riscv64), technologies (LLVM, JVM, profilers), and workloads (data analytics, deep learning, machine learning, graph analytics).\nI currently live in Paris, France with my wife and dog. We regularly travel to Brazil and France, our home countries."

DBM tools allow developers to inspect, instrument and even modify running binaries (for example to detect memory issues or trace executed instructions) by sitting in-between the operating system (OS) and user application. Examples of those tools include Intel PIN, DynamoRIO, MAMBO - subject of this talk. This talk presents MAMBO from the developer perspective, discussing how it can assist developers in implementing efficient dynamic binary analysis and instrumentation tools. The presentation describes MAMBO API - that provides callbacks invoked by the DBM tool at different points of the lifetime of the hosted application - and its plugin infrastructure, used to implement those callbacks and perform aforementioned tasks. This talk shows a number of concrete plugin examples and the live demo to present described capabilities in action.",

By now, SIMBA MOBi is a well-established model that helps the company’s decision-making process in passenger demand planning. Very early in the development stage of the model SBB has committed itself to contributing actively in the MATSim core libraries under GPL. In this talk, we briefly give an overview about the model itself, its applications and SBB’s long-standing contributions in MATSim. We also point out the advantages and limitations of using an academic open source software in our active production environment.

However, their symbolic representation hides the reality of the railway infrastructure that supports the traffic. In Open Source Railway Designer, we found it necessary to enhance the context related to the 'space' component of this diagram. We developed a custom projection, bending a map to position the origin at the bottom, the destination at the top, and the path relatively straight in between. The outcomes reveal a vertically aligned map following the Space-Time diagram, but with precise infrastructure details alongside geographic context using Open Street Map data.

          "description": "Trains are planned with margins compared to their fastest possible drive. Without them, they would not be able to catch up in case of a delay. A train departing 5 minutes late would arrive at least 5 minutes late. A driver accelerating or braking a bit slower than planned would inevitably be late. The entire transportation plan would fail. Those margins/allowances consist of adding extra time to the total running time. This implies planning trains with a lower speed than the maximum they could physically drive. There are many ways to lower the speed of a train along its trip, but one of them is particularely efficient in terms of energy savings. The algorithm MARECO, developped by SNCF, details an entire strategy for this purpose: how to plan a train that would intelligently drives slower in a way that consume the least amount of energy ? In this talk we will go though the main ideas of the algorithm, then we will compare its efficiency to other margin distribution stratgies on a few relevant examples, and finally we will discuss the impact of this algorithm on train planning and operation.",

          "description": "OSRD is a railway toolbox designed for multiple use cases. These tools have in common a reliance on railway infrastructure simulation and results analysis. In order to perform short-term digital capacity management (STDCM) or operational studies, a fine grained simulation of railway signaling systems is necessary. Every country has different signaling rules, and often multiple active signaling systems, sometimes even overlapping. This raises a challenge: how do we decouple the complexity of railway signaling and the rest of the application code, while retaining acceptable performance? In this presentation, we will present our modeling of signaling systems and how we use it to automatically detect scheduling conflicts.

It is essential for Deutsche Bahn, that prototypes can be built and tested very quickly and cost-effectively. The talk provides an insight into the open source software ThingsBoard and the IoT construction kit Tinkerforge. After this, we will make a live demo and build a IoT system to monitor the air quality in the conference room. This gives you a very easy entry into the world of IoT. Finally, we would like to share our experience in conducting IoT hackathons to find solutions or recruit young talent and present three unusual IoT use cases at Deutsche Bahn.",

Thanks to shared code with its alternative Öffi, Transportr had support for official and third-party public transport APIs of more than 60 regions from Europe and other parts of the world at its peak. Apps such as Transportr have potential to ease the path into an ecological future with a seamless experience for public transport users regardless of their location. This talk gives a recap of Transportr's history and some notes on its current state, but is mostly meant to be a starting point for discussion about the future of the app, the potential of combining efforts with similar projects, and a call for contributions to the community!",

          "description": "Real-time communication (RTC) is a fundamental building block of modern web applications, powering features like video conferencing, collaborative editing, and online gaming. Open-source technologies have played a crucial role in driving the development and adoption of RTC, offering developers flexibility and control. However, existing RTC solutions often face limitations in performance, flexibility, and interoperability, hindering the full potential of web development. This talk delves into the exciting world of WebCodecs and WebTransport, two emerging technologies poised to revolutionize the future of RTC. We'll explore the core concepts of WebCodecs, including media frame encoding and decoding, and unveil how WebTransport provides a reliable and efficient transport mechanism for real-time data exchange, leveraging open-source libraries like quic-go or quinn. Through a compelling live demo, we'll showcase the power of this innovative combination. Witness video captured directly in the browser, encoded using WebCodecs and transmitted over WebTransport using open-source libraries. On another tab, the received frames will be decoded and rendered in real-time with the canvas API. This hands-on demonstration will vividly illustrate the potential of WebCodecs and WebTransport for building next-generation open-source RTC applications with unparalleled performance and versatility.

The service has an ActivityPub implementation and clones the stream on the backend side. Shig is designed using the WHIP/WHEP approach for both incoming and outgoing streams, eliminating the necessity for an additional Signal Server. The \"cloning\" of live streams across domain boundaries enables different kinds of live video content distribution, as well as interactions with live streams, such as multi-guest streaming.

          "description": "AV1 is an open and royalty free codec, recently designed within the context of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). It was specifically designed for use over the Internet, and was built with Scalable Video Coding (SVC) functionality built in the specification. This makes it a particularly interesting codec to use in WebRTC applications of different kinds, from web conferencing to streaming and more. This presentation will cover how AV1 is used on top of RTP, how SVC is signalled and used within the context of an ad-hoc (and pretty convoluted) RTP extension, and the efforts I had to make to get all that to work in the Janus WebRTC Server. If time permits, I'll show a brief demo of how it works too.",

But building an application with GStreamer is much more complex when it comes to building using bindings to the C level api for GStreamer. Avi started building the Golang bindings back in 2020 but they'd started to become a little unloved with Pull Requests and issues becoming stale. Now the bindings have moved to their own github organisation and are getting some all important bug fixes and a new semver release of 1.0 coming soon. Building a solution doesn't always fit into what's available with GStreamer's plugins - enter appsrc and appsink, your best friends in building custom solutions with GStreamer. In this session you'll hear about using appsrc and appsink to build custom real time applications, as well as the updates coming to GStreamer's Golang binding.",

          "description": "The invention of the integrated circuit in the late 1950's led to first 4 bits generation of microprocessors/controllers in the early 70's. While the Intel 4004 was the first commercial microprocessor, the TMS 1000 for Texas Instruments was the first widely available microcontroller embedding CPU, RAM and ROM for a mere 2$. Millions of units of this family were deployed in many calculators and handheld games. This talk will have a retrospective look at this piece of history based on an Harvard architecture. We will first analyse the die, especially how to visually decode its rom content and disassemble it. Then we will have a look at its instruction set and look at the coding of some basic operations found in early calculators, including \"reversed\" calculators such as the famous little professor and other handheld games of this time. We will show this in action using the Mame emulator and have a look at how Mame handles the TMS 1000 (including some specific display or input controls, e.g. Merlin). Last but not last, you will discover and be able to play with our Big Professor A3 version based on an Arduino Nano, LED matrix and 3D printing !",

          "title": "Running DOS & Unix on an 8-bit Commodore",
          "description": "In 1983, Commodore introduced CBM-II, the successor to their aging line of PET business computers. It featured a 6502 CPU running at 2 MHz and up to 256 kB memory. But its most interesting feature was a second CPU interface, which (much like Acorn's Tube) allowed to attach various CPUs to the system. Commodore designed two cards: Z80 (for running CP/M) and 8088 (for running MS-DOS). Back in these days, though, MS-DOS had a separate version for each platform. Therefore you could only run specially crafted Commodore MS-DOS 1.25 on the computer, because it was obviously not PC-compatible. A few years ago I set out to fix this deficiency. I asked myself: is it possible to make the platform (more) PC compatible? As it turns out, it is, and practically without any modifications to the original design. You just need to write a piece of software that emulates the PC BIOS and some parts of the PC hardware platform. For this, one wire needs to be added to the hardware, which generates a NMI when an I/O chip is accessed; the emulation software then simulates the non-existing I/O peripheral. Based on this work, I was able to make the platform compatible enough to run modern FreeDOS, as well as other PC software: Norton Commander, Turbo Pascal, QBASIC and more. As a follow-up, I designed a Z8000 processor card using the second CPU interface; this card is meant to emulate the abandoned Commodore 900 Unix workstation. This is a work in progress right now; so far the card is able to boot the Commodore 900 BIOS and complete the I/O chip self test (the I/O chips are obviously also emulated in software). By the time of the talk, the progress is expected to be much farther :) The PC emulation software is available on GitHub: https://github.com/MichalPleban/cbm2-pc-emulator/ And the hardware: https://github.com/MichalPleban/cbm2-8088-ram-board/",

          "description": "The Mobile Adapter GB was a peripheral that allowed you to connect a Game Boy to a Mobile Phone, with the purpose of facilitating Internet connectivity and multiplayer. Unbeknownst to many, this was the first time big-name games like Pokémon and Mario Kart had any sort of online connectivity. However, the adapter was a flop, and it never left Japan. Now, 20 years later, the REON team is documenting and restoring the system, across the whole stack, from hardware to backend. This talk will start by covering what the Mobile Adapter GB is, and what REON is doing to restore its functionalities on both software emulators and hardware devices. Then, the discussion will delve into the details by brushing a bit on the peripheral's history, and what it's used for in different games. Finally, the presentation will end with an exploration of how the actual system works: this will help emulator developers understand how to implement the adapter, and it will also show prospective homebrew developers the peripheral's capabilities.

So Neo6502 litterally lives in the Matrix and thinks it have real peripherals attached, while this is all emulation. What makes Neo6502 modern is the possibility to use modern displays and TVs, Normal USB keyboards and Flash drives. On top of this it has access to modern interfaces like I2C and SPI which allow it to interface modern sensors, displays and other devices unleashing the Arduino like applications. With such flexibility was just matter of time to recreate all retro computers based on 6502 like Apple ][+, Apple IIe, Oric Atmos which are already done. Commodore64 and BBC Micro are in the TODO list. What makes more fun is that you dont have to just copy what was done, but you can make your own unique arhchitecture as well, with the flexibility Neo6502 presents you can make your own dream 6502 computer.

But the Sanco 8003 is a French/Japanese computer for which we found no documentation at all, as of 2023: nothing about the hardware, nothing about the software, just a few hints that it has a Z80 and can run the famous CP/M operating system. There are some amateurs here and there, but we virtually found no \"hard scene\" for this computer. In this talk, we are going to describe our journey in documenting this computer. We will show how we tore it apart, how we dumped the ROMs, how we leveraged some self-built custom hardware tools, how we followed the traces on the circuit board, how we understood the 74xx logic gates, how we disassembled the ROM and patched it to run our custom bootloader, how we experimented with sideloaded assembly to confirm (or deny) the expectations we thought of by looking at the reconstructed schematics, and, eventually, how we wrote our own emulator. Everything we do is freely accessible and publicly available as a git repository, so you can contribute too! There is a lot of work that still needs to be done, so any contribution is welcome!",

Hence a new hardware interface board was designed and built to be able to communicate by RS232, which included a \"driver\" layer (in assembly) that was properly integrated with the Spectrum ROM advanced Channels/Streams concept/feature, allowing the RS232 to be used transparently from BASIC language. The Robot protocol was reverse engineered and a BASIC application implemented to follow the protocol to allow movement of the Robot Arm. A new Module was also added to the robot, to provide a pneumatic end effector that provides for faster interaction with objects with a flat surface were suction can work effectively.",

          "description": "A backtrace is one of those Ruby features that is extremely useful, but we never think about it. They're just always there in our time of need -- be it when an error happens, when exploring our code inside a irb or a debugger, or even when profiling our app. In this talk, I’ll do a deep dive of how Ruby backtraces work inside the Ruby VM. If you’ve ever been curious about how this part of the Ruby VM works, this talk is for you! I’ll then show how I’ve used this knowledge to build the backtracie gem. The backtracie gem is an experimentation ground for creating prettier backtraces; during this talk I will discuss the extra information it can provide, and in what cases it may be useful. Finally, I’ll show how you can start using backtracie in your Ruby apps, today!",

          "description": "In this talk, we'll focus on the unique advantages of using WebAssembly (Wasm) for deploying Ruby applications (yes, on the server). Moving beyond traditional deployment methods, Wasm offers a groundbreaking approach that promises smaller, faster, and more secure server applications. We'll explore how Ruby can run in server-side Wasm environments, emphasizing the performance, security, and architectural innovations it brings. Overview: Introduction to WebAssembly: Briefly introducing Wasm, particularly its relevance and benefits for server-side deployment. Ruby and Wasm - How: Exploring how Ruby applications can be efficiently deployed on servers using Wasm, leading to more compact and faster server applications than traditional deployments with VMs or Containers. Enhanced Performance and Security: Highlighting the improved startup times and robust security features that Wasm brings to Ruby server applications. Server-Side Innovation with Wasm: Looking deeper into how Wasm is transforming server-side programming, offering new possibilities in server architecture and performance. Practical Examples: Referencing projects like WebAssembly/Ruby, Artichoke/Ruby, and, my own oss project, wasm-vfs, that demonstrate the practical applications of Ruby and Wasm on the server side. Target Audience: Server-side developers, Ruby enthusiasts, and IT professionals interested in innovative deployment and infrastructure technologies. This session will provide a focused look at how WebAssembly is reshaping the landscape of server-side application deployment, particularly for Ruby, by offering a more efficient, secure, and innovative approach compared to traditional methods.",

Careful coding is enough to avoid accidental breaking changes. None of those statements are true! In practice, SemVer is complex and accidental breakage is common: 1 in 6 of the top 1000 Rust crates has violated semantic versioning at least once, frustrating both users and maintainers alike. If you write Rust but don't have the time for a PhD in SemVer, this talk is for you. We'll take a practical look at SemVer in Rust: what it buys us, how Rust's features lead to strange SemVer edge cases, and how we can prevent accidental breakage using a SemVer linter called cargo-semver-checks.",

It aims to become a fully fledged Rust compiler, and hopes to share as much code as possible with the official Rust compiler in order to guarantee correctness and avoid damage on the Rust ecosystem. But how do we plan to integrate Rust components to the GCC codebase, and what sort of components will we reuse? This talk will explore the future of the project, as well as some of the challenges surrounding compilers, and the very silly sounding but real problems of bootstrapping and dogfooding. We will explore the stack of rustc crates that we leverage, how we use them together, and how they will play a part once the compiler has advanced further.",

          "description": "This talk presents a case study in taking a security-focused application to the next level by modifying the Rust compiler to target a capability-based architecture. We will discuss CHERI, a system that enables hardware enforcement of safety constraints at runtime using capabilities, and how we have added support for CHERI to the Rust compiler in order to improve the security of CyberHive Connect, an application that implements an end-to-end encrypted mesh network. Connect can already boast a very high level of security when we consider the protocols it uses, and we can argue that the application itself has many potential vulnerabilities eliminated by being written in Rust. However, just like most real world applications, Connect needs to make use of unsafe code in areas such as the interface with the underlying operating system. This exposes an attack surface in the form of code that the compiler can't guarantee will be safe at runtime. If, however, we make modifications to the Rust compiler to support transferring knowledge about pointer provenance, bounds and other access restrictions to CHERI's capability-based runtime enforcement, then in many cases we should be able to eliminate the potential for unsafe situations to occur. This talk will demonstrate what we have managed to achieve in terms of producing a modified Rust compiler that can target CHERI architectures. We will give an overview of what problems were solved by doing this and how we worked towards getting our real world Rust application running on CHERI.",

          "description": "Rust provides unsafe language features to interact with hardware or call into non-Rust libraries. However, this shifts responsibility for ensuring memory safety to the developer. Failing to do so may lead to memory-safety violations in unsafe code, which can violate the safety of the entire application. In this talk, we explore in-process isolation with Memory Protection Keys as a mechanism to shield safe program sections from safety violations that may happen in unsafe sections. Our approach is easy to use and comprehensive, as it prevents heap and stack-based violations. We further compare process-based and in-process isolation mechanisms and the necessary requirements for data serialization, communication, and context switching. We specifically explored various Rust serialization crates such as Abomonation and bincode. Our results show that in-process isolation can be effective and efficient, permits for a high degree of automation, and also enables a notion of application rewinding where the safe program section may detect and safely handle violations in unsafe code. However, even for modestly sized arguments, the context switch cost starts to get dominated by the cost of data transfer between domains. Here, the Rust data serialization method used can significantly impact performance and thus, it is crucial to optimize it for the use case at hand.

Yet, I frequently observe similar mistakes in Rust programming: treating it like C or Java and not fully utilizing its unique features. I've concluded that poor Rust coding often falls into a few distinct categories, which I've termed the '4 Horsemen of Bad Rust Code': Overengineering, Simplistic Design, Premature Optimization, and Neglect of Documentation and Testing. This talk will delve into these antipatterns and offer strategies to avoid them, aiming to share practical tips for writing more ergonomic and effective Rust code. During the talk, we will gradually refactor a Rust code example, transforming it from a less optimal version to a more idiomatic and efficient one.",

          "description": "Tower is a crate of “modular and reusable components for building robust networking clients and servers” widely used in prominent projects within the Rust ecosystem, including Hyper*, Axum, or Tonic. This ubiquity means Rust developers invariably engage with the Service trait, Tower's core abstraction, while working with these libraries. Despite its conciseness, reading and understanding code that abstracts over the Service trait proves challenging because of the heavy use of generics and intricacies of implementing non-boxed futures. This complexity raises the learning curve for beginner and intermediate Rust developers to become proficient in their favorite frameworks. In this talk, we will demystify the Service trait, explore practical examples from real-world codebases, and construct increasingly complex Tower layers from scratch. *Hyper actually relies on its own very similar hyper::Service trait.",

One of the goals for this year has been making Servo a practical embeddable rendering engine, making easier to embed it in Rust projects. We’ve already come a long way in this area. A key achievement is our development of a minibrowser, which showcases how the Servo engine can be integrated. In this talk, the main focus will be on the embedding of Servo. We will dive into the technical aspects of the minibrowser, demonstrating how our developments have streamlined the process of embedding Servo, the challenges we’ve faced, and the solutions we’ve developed. Additionally, we will also talk about the future direction of Servo embedding in Rust projects.",

Part of the work we have been doing in the background to enable this evolution is adding support for Rust to the Thunderbird code base. In this talk, we'll tell the story of how we achieved this and what lessons we learned along the way. We’ll also show how we’re using Rust to both improve the existing code architecture, and build new features for Thunderbird such as support for Microsoft Exchange.",

At the same time, health data is highly sensitive with regards to data protection, hence, instead of centralizing all the data, federated information systems enable researchers to locate and work with data/biospecimens having certain characteristics, e.g. specimen type, diagnosis, and molecular markers, across hospitals, countries, or even continents. At the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Germany’s largest biomedical research center, we develop, operate, and maintain such national infrastructures in hospitals and biobanks around Germany, Europe and the world, using 100% FLOSS. Recently, we have re-implemented and open-sourced key components in Rust with great benefits towards stability, safety and performance. In particular, we report on Beam, a distributed task broker for efficient communication across strict network environments, and Focus, a federated query dispatcher protecting patient privacy using differential privacy.",

Serde is a library for serialization and deserialization of any user-defined type into and from a number of different data formats. Most material about serde focuses on the user-defined types, though for this talk, I want to present the—still ongoing—journey of building a new bolt dataformat for serde. Follow me down the rabbit hole and peek under the hood of serde to show how the various types and traits interact, what gotchas and caveats await and how to craft an API that is more than just 1:1 struct <--> data mapping.",

          "description": "The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has frequently been cited as a crucial component in securing the software supply chain. Its value proposition is the ability to answer critical questions such as, \"Am I vulnerable to CVE-XYZ?\". In theory, SBOM should simplify risk assessment by prioritizing the remediation of vulnerable applications. However, when considering the software supply chain as a whole and the myriad potential threat vectors (https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats), it's clear that SBOM provides limited utility when securing end-2-end software delivery from producer to consumer. How is an SBOM produced? How is it delivered? Does it bundle the artifacts it describes? Can you verify the provenance of the SBOM? These questions lead us to ask whether the SBOM has any real utility as a standalone entity. In this session, we shall introduce the Open Component Model (OCM, https://ocm.software), an open standard and tooling that supports establishing a secure software supply chain, from producer to consumer. OCM's dedicated tooling packages security and compliance-relevant metadata, such as SBOMs, alongside the software artifacts. It includes support for signing operations, as well as secure transport of artifacts ensuring their integrity and provenance. Our session is ideal for those who find these questions intriguing and are eager to explore possible answers!",

          "description": "In 2022 the Department of Homeland Security, an agency of the US government, announced the formation of an SBOM task force, formed by seven startup companies with a mission to create basic building blocks for the software bill of materials ecosystem. Out of this effort, the protobom project was born. Protobom is a project that offers a universal, format-neutral SBOM I/O layer designed to work with SBOM data in a unified way. The project frees developers from caring about the nuisance of ingesting and writing SBOMs. Through a single interface, applications can handle any SBOM format when reading, writing and transforming the data. Protobom is defined in protocol buffers which makes it ideal for storing and transmitting SBOM data. It also means that the project is multilanguage. On top of the I/O layer, protobom has a rich graph API helping developers query, remix, diff and filter information read from SBOMs. The project is young, but it is already at the core of various supply chain security projects under the OpenSSF umbrella, including SBOMit and OpenVEX. Join us and explore how protobom abstracts and puts SBOMs at your fingertips!",

Over 80 percent of code used in enterprise applications comes from open-source dependencies, but how much attention goes towards the software bill of materials that tells you the provenance and security of those packages? This is analogous to a restaurant where you invest in modern decor, professional chefs, and world-class service. But if you don’t get fresh, quality ingredients delivered daily, the taste and hygiene of the food will suffer and the restaurant won’t be successful. Securing the software supply chain is a huge undertaking for the entire tech industry, and we will talk about some of the ongoing efforts by open-source projects, foundations, and corporations to help us all know the SBOM of our ingredients.",

Trustification allows users to manage their portfolio of applications, containers and products throughout their lifecycle. Providing transparency of their technical make up and dependencies as well as highlighting their vulnerabilities.. In this session, we will describe the Trustification project in detail. We'll start by covering basic requirements for this kind of system. Having a S3 compatible storage, flexible vulnerability collectors, support for powerful query language and ability to find the relationship between different components is the key. We'll go through the architecture and all the services needed to achieve these goals. We'll end up with a brief demo of the working system.

He's been an occasional conference speaker on community topics, a participant and twice organizer of the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS – the yearly summit for coordinating and solving issues around Perl and CPAN ecosystems and supply chain tooling), and a founding member and long-time contributor in Oslo Perl Mongers.\nHe is also a founding member of the CPAN Security Working Group, which was created specifically as a consequence of him introducing NIS2 and CRA to the PTS in April, 2023.\nLately, Salve has spent his volunteering time budget on figuring out what kind of mess he's stumbled into (SBOMs and EU laws) by talking with lots of humans and one cat. He sometimes wishes more people cared about the consequences of their actions (or inactions) on Open Source volunteers."

From 2023 the YP's reference distribution, Poky, is generating it by default in each distribution build. With numerous questions posted about the feature, it seems that many people are using it. The story does not end here, however. Joshua and Marta will explain the experience of SPDX 2.2, elements that worked and those that did not. The year 2023 has brought also the proof-of-concept implementation of the upcoming SPDX 3.0 addressing pain points of 2.2 and adding new features. This will be the other part of this talk: the proposed architecture, expected new features and decisions to be made on the actual data to output to make the SBoM the most useful for users.",

          "description": "With SBOMs being required and SPDX meeting ISO/IEC 5962:202. It is beneficial for developers to adopt SPDX to generate the SBOM for their software. However, with AL and ML taking more and more centre stage in modern applications, how can we make sure SPDX can be useful to AI/ML applications? Recently since the bill from the US government has made SBOM the standard in software distributions, all developers have started to think about how they can automate and generate SBOM with all the components stated as required. SPDX is one of the obvious choices for all as its specification is recognized as the international open standard for security. The stable release of SPDX 2.3 is good enough for most applications. Looking forward, as modern software applications are getting more and more complicated and there are more and more components involved - with the popularity of big data and AI/ML, many applications will involve data and data pipelines. These would need to be considered when generating SBOM in the future. In this talk, we will look into what has SPDX 2.3 achieved, what is added in SPDX 3.0 for data and AI, and how we can encourage the AI/Ml community to consider SPDX in their applications. Bring awareness of SBOM and SPDX to the developers and data community. Suggest some strategies in getting more adoption, especially the adoption of SPDX 3.0 to AI/ML communities. Developers and engineers who work with data. Community leaders who are interested in encouraging the community to build safer software.",

          "description": "Creating and maintaining a safety critical project comes with a lot of challenges. One central issue is keeping your documentation, starting from planning and guideline documents, down to requirements, safety analysis, reviews and tests, consistent and up to date. These project artefacts often have their own lifecycle and are natively managed in different tools, with usually great traceability capabilities regarding dependencies between these artefacts as long as you stay within one tool or within a (usually propriety) tool family of one single tool vendor. Currently the resulting traceability gaps between these tools are handled either by the popular engineering tools like MS Excel or methods like “search for identical names”, depending highly on manual maintenance. Using SPDX relationships, the upcoming Safety Profile in SPDX 3.1 will provide a model to represent all these dependencies as a knowledge model that can be used both to analyse possible impacts after a change (be it because of a security update or functional variants of your product), provide evidence of completeness and compliance as a Safety SBOM or simply keep track of your product variants. In this talk we will provide both an introduction to the SPDX Safety Profile as well as a real life example using StrictDoc and the Zephyr Project’s Functional Safety scope.",

During this talk, we'll discuss the overlooked aspect of ensuring the trustworthiness of the SBOM during its lifecycle, from generation to storage, distribution, and processing. We'll shed some light on the questions you should ask about your SBOMs, who, and how you can achieve trust at each step of their lifecycle. We'll dip our toes into the why now, and how we can leverage OpenSource tools and specifications like in-toto attestations, Content Addressable Store, Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (\"salsa\"), or Sigstore to have SBOMs that are uniquely identifiable, unforgeable, complete, and available. After this talk, you'll know how to implement SBOM end-to-end (or other metadata such as VEX, vuln scan, etc.) that meets the highest levels of trust required in the Software Supply Chains of the future. For reference, we'll touch on the following Open Source projects during this talk.",

A detailed analysis of the generated SBOMs over the past 12 months has identified a number of interesting observations which were not immediately apparent before SBOMs were being generated. It addresses some key questions such as “How much does an SBOM change and how often?“ and “ Does your SBOM depend on your environment?“.

          "description": "The increasing use of AI-driven Python libraries necessitates robust scanning of Python projects for vulnerabilities. However, Python's dynamic typing and reliance on manifest files for dependency management make it challenging to detect hidden \"phantom\" dependencies. These unreported dependencies introduce uncertainty and risk into software composition analysis, as seen in OpenAI's baseline codebase. This session explores program analysis, particularly reachability analysis, to expose these phantom dependencies and create accurate dependency sets. Despite the challenges posed by Python's dynamic nature, program analysis remains crucial for secure and reliable software development. Understanding phantom dependencies and their impact is vital for Python developers to build robust and secure software.",

The talk will show the general setup how you can continuously generate your SBOMs and reports and provide the status of the published reference implementation the \"ORT-Server\" interacting with the OSS Review Toolkit. Diversity and agility are high values in the Software community. Diversity and agility in Software Development processes and tools are a challenge for automation, though. Accurate Software Composition Analysis is an important capability to keep transparency throughout the Software Lifecycle and is the base for the fulfillment of important non-functional requirements in the business context (e.g. SBOM-creation, Vulnerability Tracking, License compliance etc.) To handle automation with both aspects - accurate Software Composition Analysis and heterogeneous and agile environments - the Abstraction Layer for Software Composition Analysis of the new Eclipse Foundation ALSCA Project plays an important role. The ALSCA-project consolidates the requirements from the tooling side on the one hand and the requirements from the institutionalized operation side in medium to large organizations on the other hand. Concerning specifications and wording it will be based on the capability map created by the Open Chain Tooling Group in the context of Open Source Management (https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/Sharing-creates-value/tree/master/Tooling-Landscape/CapabilityMap). The ALSCA-server provides blueprints to run central Software Composition Analysis pipelines at scale while covering a large range of project setups (e.g. from Mobile Apps using Cocoapods to Cloud Services using Java/Maven) and configurable extent of analysis (e.g. from mere SBOM-creation to full-blast Dependency Analysis including Vulnerabilities and Copyright/License reports).To achieve this, the ALSCA-server is based on the OSS Review Toolkit and makes use of its integration APIs for dependency analysis, license scanning, vulnerability databases, rule engine, and report generation. The ALSCA project itself will concentrate on the server functionality including user and role management and the necessary APIs.",

          "description": "SBOM and VEX represent an important step towards managing software products and software vulnerabilities more efficiently and effectively. The accelerating development of standards and tooling is driven by the promise to answer one important question: Which of the thousands of CVEs published per year affect a given software product? However, the mere presence of such documents can lull consumers into a false sense of security. Studies have shown that the accuracy of SBOM and VEX documents greatly varies from one producer to another. The production of accurate SBOM and VEX documents requires connecting products to components, components to vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities to (vulnerable) functions. But establishing those connections is hindered by development practices, the dynamics of open source projects, low-quality vulnerability databases and other factors… This talk provides a deep dive into the brittleness of those connections, supported by real-world examples from the Java/Maven ecosystem. This information helps SBOM and VEX consumers to ask the right questions when it comes to evaluating and comparing tools and vendors.",

          "description": "A major advantage of FOSS is the possibility to reuse existing components. Thus, it seems obvious to adopt the same strategy for FOSS compliance material in those areas where the required efforts are identical for all users of the software. With standard formats, such as SPDX, it is possible to share the results of data curation with the community, and thereby reduce the individual effort. The OSSelot project has set itself precisely this task: Creating a publicly available database of curated compliance materials for frequently used FOSS components including SPDX reports for each component. In order to foster usability of the data and external contributions, aspects such as trustworthiness, liability and integration of the data into existing tools must also be considered. This presentation will demonstrate the stringent curation and review process of the OSSelot data that ensures that all internal and external contributions meet the same high quality standard. It will also exemplify how the OSSelot resources can be used to fulfill FOSS license obligations. To increase the project’s practical relevance, a discussion is encouraged on how the data can be used with existing tools and what adaptions are required to do so.

          "description": "SBOMs focus basically exclusively on binary distributions. For years, copyleft activists like me have argued vehemently that they are non-functional in addressing the primary license compliance and software security problem that plagues FOSS distributions: an inability to clearly identify, and assure that all in the supply chain receive, the complete, corresponding source for the binaries in question. Due to the heavy influence and control on SBOM dialogue asserted by proprietary software companies and their business model proponents, proposals to require source code disclosures as a necessary part of the supply chain have typically been rejected. In short, SBOM focus has been to ease the ingestion of FOSS into proprietary supply chains, rather than assuring that downstream users are afforded the same rights to examination, modification, and reinstallation of FOSS that their upstreams enjoyed. Most will argue, perhaps correctly, that the ship of universal software freedom has sailed, the industry doesn't want to be on it, so why continue to debate that question in the context of SBOMs and (the mostly proprietary) software supply chains in our world today. This talk, then, proposes a simple compromise. Given the non-viability of convincing proprietary software companies that control the supply chains to actually give software rights and freedom to their users and join the Open Source world, what (this talk considers) is a requirement for SBOMs that might improve the situation for downstream users with regard to complete, corresponding source code provisioning, but would not require companies to participate in actual open source releases? I will propose in this talk a thought experiment of how we might add key information about the supply chain of the source code that produced the binaries into SBOMs without requiring actual source-code disclosure. While such an addition would be woefully inadequate to assist in compliance with copyleft licenses, it would (a) marginally improve the forensic data available to those trapped at the end of the supply chain desperate to, for example, determine whether they are vulnerable to the latest security bug and (b) provide at least a basic breadcrumbs for those who are testing copyleft compliance of products at the end of the supply chain.",

            "description": "Bradley M. Kuhn is the Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence at Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC). Kuhn began his work in the software freedom movement as a volunteer in 1992 — as an early adopter of Linux-based systems and contributor to various FOSS projects, including Perl. He worked during the 1990s as a system administrator and software developer for various companies, and taught AP Computer Science at Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati. Kuhn’s non-profit career began in 2000, when he was hired by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). As FSF’s Executive Director from 2001–2005, Kuhn led FSF’s GPL enforcement, launched its Associate Member program, and invented the Affero GPL. Kuhn began as SFC’s primary volunteer from 2006–2010, and became its first staff person in 2011. Kuhn's work at SFC focuses on enforcement of the GPL agreements, FOSS licensing policy, and non-profit infrastructural solutions for FOSS. Kuhn holds a summa cum laude B.S. in Computer Science from Loyola University in Maryland, and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Cincinnati. Kuhn's Master's thesis discussed methods for dynamic interoperability of Free Software programming languages. Kuhn received the Open Source Award in 2012, and the Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 2021 — both in recognition for his lifelong policy work on copyleft licensing and its enforcement."

Leveraging the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) framework, our solution establishes a seamless interface, shielding users from the inherent complexities associated with distributed file operations. HopsFS, a derivative of HDFS, renowned for its scalability and performance, is now easily accessible with the familiarity of a local file system through our FUSE-based innovation. By abstracting the intricacies of distributed file systems, our implementation ensures that users engage with HopsFS in a manner similar to traditional file systems. This abstraction not only reduces the entry barriers for users unfamiliar with distributed systems but also enhances the overall usability and accessibility of HopsFS.",

In Kubernetes, the CSI protocol introduced the VolumeGroupSnapshot concept which requires crash-consistent snapshots be guaranteed within the context of volumes, which may be block devices or mounts on a distributed POSIX file system such as CephFS. This talk will cover the challenges and mechanisms to achieve this design goal. In particular, we will show how CephFS provides consistency by exposing a new API to pause write IOs to a set of volumes for the duration of the snapshot process. We will explore the new API, the mechanisms used to achieve this IO pause and discuss broadly the software changes made to Ceph.",

          "description": "CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is one of the world's largest and most respected centres for scientific research. It is home to the world's largest particle accelerator (Large Hadron Collider, LHC) and is the birthplace of the Web. CERN's Storage and Data Management Group is responsible for enabling data storage and access for the CERN laboratory, in particular the long-term archival, preservation and distribution of LHC data to a worldwide scientific community (WLCG). Today we operate heterogeneous disk and tape software defined storage systems, with several large EOS disk farms, the CERN Tape Archive (CTA) system and other storage solutions. In total the group manages more than one exabyte of storage across about 2,000 data servers (60,000 disks) and 50,000 high-capacity tapes and orchestrates more than 4 exabytes of data transfers every year. More than 30,000 users need to access these data from their computers in a user-friendly way, which has been made possible through the CERNBox project, CERN's open source cloud sync and share platform. The group also operates a large Ceph cluster (over 60 petabytes) mostly to support the CERN OpenStack Cloud Computing infrastructure. All of these systems are open source and available for use and hosting on-premise. In this talk we would like to give you a high level view of the following technologies and how they work together to satisfy the storage needs of the organisation: from the early phases of data taking, to its distribution and final end-user analysis. EOS provides a service for storing large amounts of physics data and user files (accounting today for more than 1 exabyte), with a focus on interactive and batch analysis with multi-protocol support (WebDAV, HTTP, FUSE, CIFS). It supports different authentication protocols (KRB5, X509, OIDC). CTA (CERN Tape Archive) is the archival storage system for the custodial copy of all physics data at CERN. The CTA software provides a free and open source platform for managing data on magnetic tapes at scale. CERNBox is the CERN cloud storage platform that provides sync and share functionality on top of the EOS and Ceph storage systems. It is built on top of the ownCloud open source product and the Reva project. All of these systems are open source and available for use and are deployed in other laboratories around the world.",

Within edge nodes, constrained resources may require the use of hyperconverged storage solutions. OpenNebula has recently integrated Ceph as the foundational SDS solution for these edge deployments. This innovation enables the dynamic deployment of nodes through orchestrated infrastructure provisioning (based on Terraform), autoconfiguration of Ceph and virtualization subsystems (through Ansible), and cloud-edge management (using OpenNebula). This presentation discusses the seamless integration of these components to automate edge location management and to provision additional edge nodes in multi-provider edge cloud environments, highlighting the effectiveness of Ceph as an edge storage solution and showcasing a live technical demonstration of this innovative open source model.",

          "description": "Efficiently migrating petabytes of object storage data between two production Ceph clusters posed a significant challenge with live data being written to both clusters, necessitating a seamless process to minimize disruptions. The migration strategy involved extracting user accounts, including access and secret keys, from the old cluster and seamlessly transferring them to the new one. The synchronization of buckets and live data has been improved by extending and enhancing powerful tools such as rclone, executed in parallel. This migration endeavor not only resulted in the successful transfer of vast amounts of data but also paved the way for the creation of a robust tool named Chorus. Chorus, specifically designed for synchronizing S3 data, emerged as a versatile solution capable of harmonizing data seamlessly across multiple cloud storage backends. This innovative tool is helpful in effective bridging of data between Ceph clusters, demonstrating the adaptability and scalability required for modern data management challenges. Key highlights of Chorus include persistence of migration, execution of migration on multiple machines, rate limiting RAM/network usage during migration.",

          "description": "While NFS is the canonical file protocol to mount remote file servers under Linux, BSDs and other Unix-like operating systems, SMB is the equivalent in the Windows world. Both NFS and SMB offer basically the same service: Remote access to files and directories. The Linux kernel has the ability to mount SMB shares from Samba and from Windows, but special Linux semantics is not properly covered. With the now deprecated SMB1 protocol there have been Unix extensions to make SMB1 a proper alternative to NFS. For a couple of years now, work is going on to extend the current SMB3 protocol to make it a proper alternative to NFS with all semantics that Linux clients expect. This talk will present the current status and where we are with respect to SMB3 POSIX extensions.",

          "description": "Are you curious about how files from different operating systems talk to each other? Samba is like a magic translator for computers that speak different file-sharing languages. It's a software that helps different types of operating systems, like Windows and Linux to talk to each other and share files and even printers! Lets explore about Samba and its integration within the Samba in SIT Environment. This session illuminates a defined path for enthusiasts looking to dig deeper by introducing a hassle free integration of samba on various file systems like XFS, GlusterFS, CephFS etc. You can even see us demonstrating it! Through the lens of SIT Test Cases, housed on GitHub, we'll explore tangible insights gained from experimenting with Samba across different file systems. Join us as we unravel the possibilities. Try using Samba on your favorite file system. Contribute to Samba Integration Testing(SIT) environment and SIT Test Cases and help in making Samba best compliant on your favorite filesystems.",

Garage is developped by Deuxfleurs, an experimental self-hosting collective. Garage targets primarily home-grown clusters composed of second-hand commodity hardware, spread over multiple physical locations for redundancy. Garage is built from scratch to tolerate slow nodes, high latency between nodes and temporary network failures or node crashes while still providing satisfactory quality of service. Since our last talk at FOSDEM 2022, Garage has matured significantly, with a v1.0 release on the horizon. This talk will cover major changes in recent Garage versions and present our findings on the best practices for deploying and scaling storage clusters.",

The CSI-Addons project hosts extensions to the CSI specification to provide advanced storage operations. By adding new procedures to the CSI-Addons Specification, additional operations for storage systems can be provided. The reference implementation is done on Kubernetes, and maintained in the Kubernetes CSI-Addons repository. Some of the advanced storage operations that are currently supported are reclaim space, network fence and volume replication.",

The answer is yes, of course, but not all classic algorithms (FIR, DDC, etc.) can be used \"as is\", sometimes a different approach must be taken. In this presentation, I will share the solutions that I implemented to achieve multi-channel DDC on NVIDIA Jetson GPU and will make a comparison with \"classic CPU\" approaches.",

          "description": "The trx-control project is a modern, modular, and, extensible software system to control transceivers, usb relays, rotators and other ham related gear. Client-server by nature, supporting plain TCP/IP and WebSockets on one side, offering a flexible way to attach hardware and transceivers on the other side. Internally fully multi-threaded and asynchronous. trx-control is a completely fresh approach at controlling transceivers. It provides a rock-solid, multi-threaded, asynchronous framework to control different classes of hardware. It supports transceivers that are able to send status updates on their own as well as transceivers that need polling. A main goal of the development was that adding drivers for new transceivers (or other types of hardware) is easy and can be done in an easy-to-learn, easy-to-understand scripting language, Lua in this case. This talk will - given the limited time available - describe the project without going too much into details. For those interested, the full source code is available on GitHub under a liberal open source license.",

          "description": "Using a WiFi emitter as radiofrequency source illuminating a scene under investigation for slow movement (e.g. landslides), a Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture RADAR (GB-SAR) is assembled using commercial, off the shelf hardware. The dual-channel coherent Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver records the non-cooperative emitter signal as well as the signal received by a surveillance antenna facing the scene. Spatial diversity for azimuth mapping using direction of arrival measurement is achieved by moving the transmitter and receiver setup on a rail along a meter-long path -- the longer the better the azimuth resolution -- with quarter wavelength steps. The fully embedded application runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 single board computer executing GNU Radio on a Buildroot-generated GNU/Linux operating system.

          "description": "SPINO is a versatile telecommunication solution suitable for nanosatellites and Cubesats. Operating in UHF and VHF bands, it features tight integration with amateur radio service and the worldwide amateur radio community. The SPINO SC board will be a pre-validated open source brick available off the shelf for any nanosatellites mission. The development of the SPINO SC board was initiated by enthusiats involved in non-profit / educational space projects. Since 2019, the project is supported by the joint efforts of two non-profit organizations: AMSAT-Francophone (site.amsat-f.org) and the hackerspace Electrolab (electrolab.fr). Thanks to the support provided to \"UVSQ-SAT\" mission by the amateur radio community (data collection, ground segment support, spectrum coordination support...), LATMOS offered to integrate this experimental board into its new satellite \"INSPIRE-Sat 7” as an additional payload. The SPINO SC board features functions dedicated to the spacecraft infrastructure: Receiver function for remote control commands from ground… Managed or Autonomous beacon (support for OBC failure) Data stream (uplink and downlink) Antenna deploy support And functions dedicated to the amateur radio community: a versatile digital transponder a digital mailbox service A SPINO Groundstation Control Software is also part of the project By the way, the goal is to maximize compatibility (standardized interfaces with UART, I2C, SPI, CAN FD, and standardizerd PC-104 \"like\" form factor), and maximize reliability (wide supply voltage range, fail-safe on key points, low power consumption, especially in idle to face failure situations). SPINO SC operates in the Amateur Radio service bands, and features two full transceivers : VHF : TX (+30dBm) and RX 144-146MHz UHF : TX (+27dBm) and RX 430-440MHz",

Currently it provides a firmware image for the ADALM Pluto and other radios based on the AD936x and Zynq. This firmware can display a real-time waterfall at up to 61.44 Msps in a WebSDR-like interface using WebGL2 rendering, and record IQ data in SigMF format in the SDR DDR. The FPGA design is implemented in Amaranth, an Python-based HDL, and the software stack is implemented in Rust, targetting the embedded ARM CPU and WebAssembly. The first firmware version was released in February 2022, and the project was presented in June in the Software Defined Radio Academy. In this talk we cover the progress since the summer, including the addition of support for devices such as the Pluto+ and AntSDR. We focus on the technical details of the project and the possibilities for re-using some of the components in other projects.",

          "description": "IQEngine is a free and open source web-based toolkit for analyzing, processing, and sharing RF recordings. It is built on top of the FOSS SigMF metadata standard, and the canonical instance of the site running at www.iqengine.org acts as a central repository for example SigMF recordings, while being a valuable tool for signal analysis and RF/DSP education. Using IQEngine's plugin API, GNU Radio (GR) flowgraphs in \"No GUI\" mode can be triggered to run on the backend, with resulting IQ samples or other outputs such as signal detection/classification immediately visible on the IQEngine spectrogram interface. This allows authors of flowgraphs to quickly test functionality on a variety of RF recordings, and debug the output, all in a web browser without having to install anything. Authors of these flowgraphs and non-GR RF functions can add their function to www.iqengine.org as a plugin in order to share it with the world. This talk will demo the current tool and discuss the organization of the community-led open-source project and how individuals can get involved. https://github.com/iqengine/iqengine https://iqengine.org/",

          "description": "turboseti served as the workhorse software and algorithm used to search for extraterrestrial intelligence over the the past decade. The Breakthrough Listen project has an updated pipeline for narrowband doppler drifting signals that learns from the last decade of data collection from the Green Bank Telescope, The Allen Telescope Array, Very Large Array, and Meerkat. This talk will give an overview of the new and improved narrowband doppler drifting search pipeline created for the Breakthrough Listen project which searches for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence using radio telescopes. The new pipeline called BLISS (Breakthrough Listen Interesting Signal Search) includes a new C++-based device-aware ndarray library called BLAND (Breakthrough Listen Arrays with N-Dimensions) heavily utilizing dlpack for easy interaction with a large ecosystem of neighboring scientific computing tools used in software radio such as numpy, cupy, matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow. We will show how this library works with a quick overview of \"why ndarrays\" and build on top of that to work through the whole pipeline from 100m dish to detected signals. The current pipelines process hundreds of MHz of instantaneous bandwidth which is channelized in to various data products including down to channels of single-digit Hz. These fine channels are then used to search for narrowband doppler drifting signals. This search is sorting through the galactic haystack for needles which don't originate from earth. We'll highlight how we mitigate radio frequency interference, algorithmically search for signals with both single dish & arrays, what's new & corrected in the updated pipeline from historic SETI pipelines, and ways to join the SETI open source community. In addition to the focus of narrowband doppler drifting signal search with device-aware ndarrays that provide absurd ecosystem compatibility, we'll show off polyphase channelization and signal processing with ndarrays that demonstrate how BLAND can be used generally for software radio.",

          "description": "SIDLOC (Spacecraft Identification and Localization) is a proposed standard for satellite and spacecraft identification and localization. It is developed as an ESA funded ARTES activity by Libre Space Foundation. The goal of the SIDLOC system is to provide reliable spacecraft identification and orbit determination, especially early after the deployment. The SIDLOC system relies on a reduced size autonomous transmitter that requires minimal integration and area on the carrier spacecraft. The ground segment of the SIDLOC system utilizes the existing SatNOGS network and the UHF band to perform the signal demodulation and identification. The SIDLOC system uses DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) PSK modulated signals with an effective bitrate of ~50 bits/s. Through an accurate Doppler frequency shift estimation mechanism, the SIDLOC system provides orbit determination capabilities, enabling open and independent SSA (Space Situational Awareness) activities.",

We'll explore the pivotal role of standardized practices in CI/CD pipelines, fostering consistency and reducing friction in the development lifecycle. We will also look at how well-defined pipeline architecture and standardized configurations, can empower developers with a smoother and more efficient workflow. We will also discuss the critical importance of interoperability in CI/CD systems. Enabling seamless collaboration across the diverse toolsets and environments that exist today is a core advantage of interoperability. This enhancing flexibility, and allows teams to leverage their preferred tools without compromising the overall development pipeline. The attendees will walk away with a roadmap to creating a collaborative and efficient development culture which prioritizes Developer Experience through innovative CI/CD practices. We will use a few OSS projects as examples: Argo, Flux, Spinnaker, and Backstage.",

Besides studying I have been working in Red Hat as a quality engineer and team lead for almost 6 years now on various projects: * Enmasse * PatrIoT * Debezium <3\nCurrently, I am mostly working on * Debezium project which I find very interesting and I love working with the whole community around it. * Skodjob project, this project was created some years ago by me and my colleagues David Kornel, and Jakub Stejskal. It contains various tooling for long-running test environments on the Openshift environment together with database performance tooling.\nOther than that, I am still trying to find time to work on some of my older projects like Rust MQTT which was the first Async Rust MQTT client for embedded devices at the time."

          "description": "Flakes aka tests that don’t behave deterministically, i.e. they fail sometimes and pass sometimes, are an ever recurring problem in software development. This is especially the sad reality when running e2e tests where a lot of components are involved. There are various reasons why a test can be flaky, however the impact can be as fatal as CI being loaded beyond capacity causing overly long feedback cycles or even users losing trust in CI itself. For the KubeVirt project we want to remove flakes as fast as possible to minimize the number of retests required. This leads to shorter time to merge, reduces CI user frustration, improves trust in CI, while at the same time it decreases the overall load for the CI system. We start by generating a report of tests that have failed at least once inside a merged PR, meaning that in the end all tests have succeeded, thus flaky tests have been run inside CI. We then look at the report to separate flakes from real issues and forward the flakes to dev teams. As a result retest numbers have gone down significantly over the last year. After attending the session the user will have an idea of what our flake process is, how we exercise it and what the actual outcomes are.",

This is why in 2023 we decided to dog-food Kairos and used it to build our infra as code.

The focus is on demonstrating practical, hands-on applications of chaos experiments to underline how they can enhance the resilience and reliability of Kafka clusters managed by Strimzi in a Kubernetes environment. The presentation begins by introducing the fundamental principles of chaos engineering, establishing a foundation for the subsequent demonstrations. The core of the session features a series of detailed demonstrations, each focusing on a specific chaos experiment. These experiments and their effects on the Strimzi-managed Kafka clusters are carefully observed and analyzed, utilizing tools such as Grafana and Prometheus from the CNCF projects. Through these demonstrations, attendees will gain a clear understanding of various tools and techniques used to create and manage failure scenarios. This part of the session is designed to provide a vivid insight into how different types of disruptions can impact system stability and performance, emphasizing the practical aspects of chaos engineering in a real-world environment. Throughout the session, we will discuss and demonstrate: - Setting Up the Environment: Preparation of a Strimzi-managed Kafka cluster on Kubernetes for chaos experiments. - Designing Chaos Experiments: Crafting realistic and meaningful chaos scenarios tailored to Kafka clusters. - Implementing Experiments: Step-by-step execution of chaos experiments, including network failures, pod deletions, and resource constraints. - Monitoring and Analysis: Utilizing monitoring tools to observe the impact of chaos experiments and analyze system behavior under stress. Using Prometheus and Grafana. - Learning and Adapting: Interpreting results to improve system design and resilience strategies.",

          "description": "Progressive Delivery makes it easier to adopt Continuous Delivery, by deploying new versions to a subset of users and evaluating their correctness and performance before rolling them to the totality of the users, and rolled back if not matching some key metrics. Feature flags and Canary deployments are some of the techniques in Progressive Delivery, used to roll out new versions gradually. For containerized workloads running on Kubernetes it is very easy to adopt Progressive Delivery using Argo Rollouts. At Adobe Experience Manager we are deploying over 10k non Adobe customer services to Kubernetes. New deployments can occur multiple times per day from internal changes or from customer code, which can be very different from one customer to another. A new feature or piece of code can work fine for 99% of customers but still affect the other 1%, and being able to detect this from just tests is a very costly process. We will show how to implement a Progressive Delivery pipeline with Argo Rollouts to improve the reliability of the service and prevent regressions. It allows the protection of the service and automation of roll backs to a previous version if needed. This allows for faster delivery with more confidence so regressions are less likely to affect a customer.",

Modern CI platforms and tools make it trivial to build an initial CI configuration and have it plugged in the development workflow. They however don't solve the ongoing maintenance cost, as any CI system requires maintaining a specific logic for creating a suitable build environment on the CI runners, meaning that every change to the build requirements will have to be duplicated in the CI setup. And that duplication means that the different setups will inevitably drift out of sync, leading to head-banging errors that will only happen in one setup but not another. This talk is about leveraging Nix to be able to declare an environment that can be used both locally, and on any CI service, so that the maintenance cost becomes minimal, and the environments are guaranteed to stay in sync.",

          "description": "Using go-internal/testscript, a little known library of filesystem testing tools, we can test Go command-line programs within the go test framework, with a high degree of integration. Testing command-line programs feels awkward in Go. You can test the program's functions, of course, but what about making sure the whole thing works, with command line arguments, flags, and options? We can build the program and run shell scripts, but that process is cumbersome, not integrated, and easy to let errors slip by. Enters go-internal/testscript, a testing library that was designed to test the go tool itself. With it, we can test our command-line applications without leaving the 'go test' framework. The testscript environment already offers built-in commands and conditions to test our application in many ways. For the advanced user, moreover, there is the possibility of creating custom commands and checks that make the test fit our development needs properly. Attendees of this talk will learn: * how to start with testscript, by testing any command-line application, whether it is produced by your project or not; * how to integrate testscript into your project, and test the resulting binary within the test environment, without any additional steps; * how to customise testscript runs using custom commands and conditions.",

Do you know which parts of your application are adequately tested, and where the 'blind spots' may be? In this talk we will explore the concepts behind mutation testing, talk about the pitfalls that have been overcome in the last 40+ years and show how (and why) today is the time to start applying mutation testing in your projects. This talk uses practical examples and insights from (the development of) Stryker-Mutator.",

          "description": "Testing an init system is not an easy task. As it is impossible to have more than a single init system running as PID 1 on a machine, testing an init system is only feasible by using external testing hardware or virtual machines. In this talk we'll go over systemd's existing integration test suite, how it works, and our current project to migrate the integration test suite to run in virtual machine images produced by mkosi, systemd's image builder sister project. We'll also discuss many of the features systemd and mkosi provide that make running integration tests in virtual machines a breeze. This includes but is not limited to communicating the exit status of an integration test to the host system once the integration test finishes, automatically running the integration test once the virtual machine has booted, using ephemeral instances of the same image for each individual test to make it trivial to run tests in parallel, automatically tunneling test logs out of the virtual machine and more. https://github.com/systemd/systemd/ https://github.com/systemd/mkosi",

          "description": "Updating a new version of a third-party library is traditionally not a trivial task. Github's Dependabot, Renovate, and similar services automatically create a new branch with the latest version of a library dependency and then execute project tests to detect any breaking changes. While such services are gaining a lot of traction, no study looks into whether test suites of average GitHub Projects have sufficient coverage and are adequate to detect incompatible library changes. To better understand the state of test coverage and effectiveness of project test suites for detecting incompatible library changes in open-source projects, I will, in this talk, present a study comprising 262 Java projects on GitHub. By artificially injecting faulty changes in library dependencies, we identify that test suites, on average, have coverage of 58% of their direct and 20% of their transitive dependencies. The average test suite effectively detects 47% of faulty updates in direct dependencies and 35% in transitive dependencies. Based on our findings, I will explain recommendations for developers and toolmakers that could improve the reliability and expectations of automated dependency updating.",

In this talk you'll hear about a selection of tools that are good additions to your documentation pipeline, and how to use them both locally and in CI. We'll cover linting and validation of your source content, and look at tools that can help with consistent formatting. We'll also look at content quality tools, such as prose linting, link checking, and more. You'll see examples of projects that use some or all of these tools in anger, and we'll also discuss when too many tools is too many! This session is recommended for anyone who works on documentation platforms as either writer or engineer, and wants to make their world better.",

Reading good documentation is deceptively easy, and writing good documentation which is easy to read is hard. Both native and non-native English speakers find communicating useful and clear information in technical documentation is a challenge. Style guides from Google, Microsoft, and many others exist, but those are huge amounts of documentation themselves and are very difficult to memorize. on. In this presentation, we will cover: - Why consistent style is valuable in improving accessibility, inclusivity, readability, and clarity of documentation - The challenges of ensuring consistency, including managing exceptions and defining priorities of style rules. - Managing change for divers audience needs on the audience - Creating clear explanations so that writers feel empowered with knowledge rather than berated with pedantry - Demonstrating open source tooling that solves these challenges using Vale, a configurable, open source tool, an extensible rule set, support for many markup languages, and editor and CI integrations. We'll also demonstrate: - Getting started using existing rulesets - Specific rules written and open source by Grafana - Configuring Vale for a project",

Since then, I have been involved in using Material for MkDocs for both creating new and revamping existing documentation sites, in collaboration with others: In this talk I want to try and convince you that you should be using Material for MkDocs too. I will present a high-level overview of the project, highlight the features that got me hooked, and share my personal experience with using it to produce technical documentation. To demonstrate how easy it is to get started with Material for MkDocs from scratch, I will build a small documentation website step-by-step live during the talk to showcase some of its features. Material for MkDocs makes writing documentation easy and rewarding, and significantly lowers the bar to produce good looking yet practical technical documentation for free and open source software projects. It features a broad set of features, including (but not limited to): Material for MkDocs is open source first (MIT-licensed), and follows the sponsorware release strategy (see Insiders). This means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors and later become part of the free community edition when specific funding goals are met, which helps making the project sustainable. It is used by plethora of FOSS projects & beyond, like:",

A model gives us the opportunity to query it, run tests against it and verify it's validity.

          "description": "ChatGPT is considered to bring the end to search engines. But it's also a pretty good liar, just making stories up. As chat-based search engines, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence, use an LLM (Large Language Model), they have no other knowledge than an algorithm that predicts the most likely word that should follow the previous ones. On top of that, these LLMs are not up-to-date, as they are generated with a \"snapshot\" of available data at a specific date when the LLM is being developed. But how do we cope with the challenge that our managers and end-users want us to provide a chat-based user interface that produces correct results? At Azul, all our public knowledge about Java and the products we deliver is combined on docs.azul.com. It's a \"classic documentation\" website, generated as a static website based on AsciiDoc files. As Java lovers, we experimented with several free, open-source tools to make our docs chat-searchable. Join this session to learn if we can dump traditional docs and enter the chat age...",

Often these documents include static code examples to help the reader understand the material. We believe that making these code examples interactive benefits both the reader and the author. To prove our point, we'll show how to make any type of documentation interactive - from programming languages to databases, frameworks and tools, and even individual packages. We will demonstrate our approach using the open source tooling (https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi).",

Can we just bring existing general purpose Linux distributions to these environments and get the advertised confidentiality guarantees? Do we need to develop something or maybe we just need to have a specific OS image configuration to enjoy the benefits? The talk will try to answer these questions and explain the differences in the design of the various CVM instance types and discuss the current state of development of various important component upstream as well as their integration in general purpose Linux distributions (Fedora, CentOS Stream, RHEL). Focusing on providing confidentiality of the data at rest, existing technologies providing boot time integrity (SecureBoot, Measured boot, vTPMs,...) will be discussed. Finally, some of the remaining gaps in various components (Linux kernel, systemd, cloud-init,...) will be highlighted.",

          "title": "From Virtualization Platform to Hybrid Cloud Solution: A Hands-On Account",
          "description": "As organizations increasingly shift towards hybrid cloud, many are expected to face the following challenge: how to migrate virtual workloads from traditional virtualization platforms, like vSphere, oVirt or OpenStack, to a hybrid cloud solution, like OKD? There are a variety of strategies and tools available for such a transition to choose from. In this session, we will see one of these strategies, in which workloads keep running in virtual machines alongside containers on top of OKD, based on our recent experience in migrating real-world virtual machines from oVirt to KubeVirt using Forklift. In mid-2023, our engineering team at Red Hat took the task of migrating all the virtual machines from an internal oVirt environment to a new OKD deployment. Our oVirt environment was in use for more than a decade, running hundreds of production VMs as well as VMs for development purposes. Given the nature of the workloads, it was impractical, and in some cases not even possible, to containerize the workloads. Therefore, we decided to go ahead and take Forklift for a spin, and move the VMs to run on OKD using KubeVirt, with minimal changes to the workloads that run inside them. At first glance, this kind of migration appears fairly straightforward, doesn't it? Especially considering we now have access to mature tools for VM migrations, like virt-v2v and ovirt-imageio, that are orchestrated by the Forklift operator. And specifically, when migrating from oVirt to KubeVirt, the same virtualization stack is used on both ends. However, in reality, the migration process was more complex than anticipated, with quite a few factors to consider and operations that were needed to complement the functionality in Forklift. This session presents tips and insights for migrations from legacy virtualization platforms to OKD, through our test case of transitioning from oVirt to OKD using Forklift. Without assuming prior knowledge of the platforms and tools discussed, we will cover the entire migration process using Forklift, and explain scripts we implemented and strategies we used for a smooth transition to OKD. Join us to learn from our journey, so by the end of this session you will have a clear understanding of the necessary steps to successfully execute your organization's transition projects.",

          "description": "In automotive, Android guests are currently used for deploying infotainment systems. To support Android as a guest, the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) requires a set of virtual hardware like sound, video and networking. In this context, VirtIO has spreaded as a standard interface for virtual devices. Having VirtIO for hardware allows Android to be deployed in different VMMs that support VirtIO like Crosvm or QEMU. This talk presents the current efforts to implement virtio-sound for infotainment systems in automotive. The implementation of virtio-sound can be split into two: the device or backend and the driver or the frontend. Generally speaking, the driver runs in the guest OS and it is not different from other sound drivers. The sound driver exposes an API to the user-application in guest and then communicates to the device to serve those requests like playing a sound or recording audio. The device usually runs in the host and processes the requests that come from the driver. There are different ways to implement the device, e.g., as a built-in device in QEMU, using vhost or vhost-user. In this talk, we talk about our decision to implement virtio-sound as an vhost-user device. In this case, the device runs in the host machine as a separate process independent of the QEMU process. This deployment has benefits like reducing the attack surface of QEMU and also enables more granularity in setting up rights for the device process. Our implementation is able to handle different audio backends by relying on a generic interface. Currently, we support the pipewire and Alsa as audio backends. During this presentation, we propose to share our journey in building the virtio-sound device, including improving its specification, fixing bugs in the virtio-sound driver, and building it as a rust-vmm project. We also plan to outline a roadmap for the future like adding support for other audio backends like Gstreamer.",

          "description": "OCI (OpenStack Cluster Installer) is a software to provision an OpenStack clusters automatically. This package installs a provisioning machine, which uses the below components: Once computers in the cluster boot for the first time, a Debian live system is served by OCI over PXE, to act as a discovery image. This live system then reports the hardware features back to OCI. Computers can then be installed with Debian from that live system, configured with a puppet-agent that will connect to the puppet-master of OCI. After Debian is installed, the server reboots, and OpenStack services are provisioned, depending on the server role in the cluster. OCI is fully packaged in Debian, including all of the Puppet modules. After installing the OCI package and its dependencies, no other artificat needs to be installed on your provisioning server, meaning that if a local debian mirror is available, the OpenStack cluster installation can be done completely offline. This presentation will introduce OpenStack Cluster Installer, and explain how it works, its general principle, and why it's a very good solution to manage your OpenStack deployment on Debian.

In QEMU, we never had the ability to directly execute and test ACPI/SMBIOS tables from within a running guest. This work adds the ability to test QEMU generated acpi tables using biosbits. We can add new tests incrementally. For QEMU, we maintain a fork of bios bits in gitlab containing numerous fixes along with all the dependent submodules. Within the QEMU repo, we add new python based avocado tests for bits. Care has been taken so that an ACPI contributor can add new tests for bits without having to know too much about biosbits itself or even touching the biosbits repository. This test framework is available from QEMU v7.2. The talk will give some details on the bios bits avocado tests, how to execute them, how to add new tests etc. It will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of this framework.",

          "description": "What if you need to connect your Kubernetes workloads to a physical network, or more than one network? You can attach multiple network interfaces using Multus, but you'll need to specify every detail. Virtualized workloads have extra requirements from the network, given their stateful nature. For instance, they require their IP addresses to be preserved during their life-cycle, and also during live migration. Currently, since the network does not provide these features, the network-admin must deploy and configure extra services in the network. But, what if you had a SDN (software defined network) to take care of that, and while doing so abstract how to bridge hybrid infrastructure, from bare metal, to virtualized, to public cloud environments? Join us to learn and understand how these features can be used to provide Kubernetes workloads access to physical networks (protected by network policies) through a live demo. The multi-network feature is paramount to delivering non-cloud deployments with enough flexibility for their use cases: connecting to the physical networks of their data-centers is extremely important, since some of their services are not deployed in Kubernetes. For security reasons, access to/from the workloads running in Kubernetes should be governed by network policies. OVN-K multi-networking also provides an opinionated network fabric that can automate what users previously had to specify in detail, simplifying configuration and cost of operation for cloud providers and admins. While any pod will benefit from the above, KubeVirt workloads (VMs) will get more juice out of this SDN implementation. While the feature-set available today is good enough to allow users of traditional virtualization platforms to lift-and-shift their existing workloads into KubeVirt, the features in the pipeline are game changers: VM workloads requires things from the network a pod wouldn’t normally ask for, such as preserving the IP during its life cycle, and also during migration (so the established TCP connection can survive being moved to a different Kubernetes node). These features are a really good match for OVN-Kubernetes since OVN already provides some migration-centered improvements used on other platforms (i.e. Openstack) which can be re-used to provide seamless live-migration of the VM workloads.",

          "description": "Virtual Machine snapshots intentionally duplicate the state of a running Virtual Machine, so that we can go back in time or spawn new, identical, VMs from it. However, snapshots capture state that is meant to be unique and/or secret, such as entropy seeds, UUIDs, network configuration etc. Recently, Linux added support for Virtual Machine Generation ID to de-duplicate the state of its internal PRNG upon Virtual Machine clone events. However, other parts of the kernel and user-space components lack proper mechanisms for adjusting. This can lead to functional issues, e.g. two VMs in the same network with the same network configuration, as well as security concerns, e.g. two user-space CSPRNGs returning identical \"random\" streams of bits. In this talk we will describe the snapshot safety problem and speak about existing mechanisms for tackling it and our efforts to extend those. Moreover, we will discuss why we believe that a solution to this problem calls for collaboration among the hypervisor, guest kernel and guest user-space. Finally, we will present our latest efforts for building mechanisms that allow tackling the issue end-to-end.",

AIOps platforms can collect and aggregate the increasing volumes of data generated by multiple IT infrastructure components, provide real-time monitoring and analysis of cloud and edge resources, detect significant events and patterns related to application performance and availability before they become critical, and even in some cases automatically resolve these issues without human intervention. Based on these concepts, our presentation will introduce a new experimental AIOps framework developed in OpenNebula and its Prometheus integration for the evaluation of AI techniques in order to provide intelligent workload forecasting and infrastructure orchestration capabilities to automate and optimize the provisioning and deployment of geographically distributed edge/cloud infrastructures and applications. We will also present the results of the evaluation of AI-based time series forecasting techniques to predict the CPU usage of VMs, and optimization techniques for the placement of VMs on top of the physical infrastructure, based on CPU usage predictions.",

Understanding container networking may feel like a superpower and Kubernetes on Bare Metal may sound like dark magic, but don’t get scared. We all know Bare Metal helps your AI/ML applications to run faster, but the learning curve can be steep. Kubernetes manages host networking on the nodes it deploys. Isn’t it a chicken and egg situation? What exactly happens with the network traffic inside a Kubernetes cluster? Which host interfaces are used by Kubernetes? Where to look to troubleshoot network issues with your workload? Last but not least, how to make your network lightning fast? In this session we will explain everything you need to understand how on-prem networking works. Loadbalancers, DNS, whatever you need. We will give you a simple way to deploy your workload, even on the most complex topologies. To make it more entertaining, we will demo a cluster running on a platform that ultimately broke our understanding of what on-prem and what a cloud is, putting a question mark on some fundamental definitions. Join us and deploy your own bare metal cloud tomorrow.",

Virtual machines run alongside containers thanks to the KubeVirt project. When disaster strikes one data center, you can recover by failing over to another data center. The RamenDR project handles data protection and orchestrates disaster recovery flows for containers and VMs alike. All of this is powered by open source projects and many contributors. But how can you develop and test a complex software stack that is designed to run on multiple racks of hardware in a data center? In this talk we introduce a virtual machine disaster recovery software stack that runs on three Kubernetes clusters. We will demonstrate a disaster scenario using a tool, drenv, which can create a multi-cluster environment including Rook Ceph storage, KubeVirt, and RamenDR on your laptop with one simple command. Attend this talk if you: are interested in complex Kubernetes environments, want to learn how drenv can help your project, or if you like watching risky live demos at conferences. Links:",

During the talk I would like talk about the internals of a RUM system, to stress on the performance data handling, why I've chosen ClickHouse as timeseries database, why I've chosen Grafana as a visualisation platform and how all the components of the system are related.",

          "description": "The RUM Archive is the Real User Monitoring-focused counterpart to the synthetic results from the HTTP Archive. It contains (aggregated and anonimized) measurements from millions of end users, as seen by the mPulse RUM tool on the Akamai CDN network. Containing over 1.5 years of data, the RUM Archive doesn't just provide insight into current real-world performance aspects, but also help us to understand trends and evolutions over time, for a variety of metrics and data dimensions. In this talk, we will first discuss how the RUM Archive works underneath; the data it holds and some examples on how to extract it yourself. We then move to analyzing some of the data contained within, looking at differences between for example browsers, operating systems and devices, and how those can impact performance metrics. We also discuss RUM-specific challenges, such as dealing with noise in the measurements, and show how this can make a big difference in the conclusions we draw from the data. We end with some critical discussion on the state of Web performance testing, emphasizing the need for both synthetic and RUM measurements, and taking a long hard look at our over-reliance on CrUX, the Google Core Web Vitals and Chromium.",
