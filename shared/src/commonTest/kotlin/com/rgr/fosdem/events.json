For this reason, we firmly believe that it is essential to promote sovereignty, transparency, and openness in this strategic field. Having built the OpenLLM-France open source community (https://www.openllm-france.com/) with more 360 individual/company members, LINAGORA is now looking to expand this vision to the whole of Europe, taking into account the numerous languages that it represents. This talk will present associated challenges and show how we plan to address them. It will also include a call to all stakeholders at the Europe level interested in testing, experimenting with, and implementing open source LLMs to join us in this community.",

          "description": "LINAGORA, as a leader in the Open LLM France community, has made it a priority to pull the curtain off of the process of building Large Language Models (LLMs). While most LLMs in use today – even the “open” ones – reveal few to no details about their training, and especially the data on which they are trained, we have decided to share it all. In this talk, we discuss why using an open model trained on traceable data is important for business and research alike and examine some of the difficulties involved in pursuing an open strategy for LLMs. We bring to the table our experience with data collection and training of LLMs, including the Claire family of language models.

          "description": "Knowing the \"cost\" of a specific piece of code, either in terms of runtime or in terms size, is quite important in guiding optimization efforts. However, understanding the actual cost of a piece of code, especially its runtime cost, is quite nontrivial. Benchmarks can be hard to run reliably, might require specialized hardware or software environments, and can be quite noisy. While the machines that the code we wish to analyze runs on are fundamentally deterministic, the lack of availability of low-level details from CPU/GPU manufacturers inhibits low-level performance analysis work. To this end, we present two pieces of work towards achieving production-ready ML-based cost modes. Firstly, GNNs to analyze the performance of small snippets of assembly, and secondly small LLMs to predict the final size of a functions as a stepping stone towards performance prediction. In addition, we outline other work in the area, such as dataset construction, to enable further experimentation on these problems within the community.",

          "description": "In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we're witnessing a significant shift in deep-learning design patterns, particularly with the advancement of foundational models. A key innovation in this area is the concept of 'adapters' – small yet powerful add-ons that enhance an existing neural network with new capabilities without retraining its core layers. However, this innovation brings a hefty software engineering challenge, mainly when we discuss creating an open-source library encompassing a diverse range of these adapters. Neural networks, by their nature, are built using frameworks that procedurally encode their operations. Every time a new adapter is introduced, it often requires a substantial rewrite or rethinking of the existing code base. To address this challenge, we've developed 'Refiners' – a streamlined micro-framework built on top of PyTorch, one of the most popular machine learning frameworks. The goal of Refiners is to serve as a comprehensive collection of foundational models and their respective adapters. Its primary design pattern sets it apart: envisioning all neural networks as a 'Chain' of primary layers, neatly nested one after the other. Furthermore, we've integrated the 'Context API,' a feature that allows the implementation of complex models, including those that don't follow a simple linear structure. By doing so, Refiners simplifies the integration of new adapters, making it easier for developers to build and enhance neural networks without the need to overhaul their entire code base each time. This approach saves time and opens up new possibilities for innovation in AI development.",

          "description": "More and more applications are being developed which consume Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is used in applications as diverse as fraud detection, medical detection, sales, security, and many more. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017 and companies are now promoting an AI first strategy with their products and services. But if a developer wants to consume AI in their applications, do they need to be an AI expert? The simple answer is No! In this talk application developers will learn how they can treat AI the same as any other \"function\" where they give it input and it returns the expected output. This is made possible by open source AI frameworks that enable users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. Discussion will revolve around open source frameworks like Ray, TGIS, Triton and TorchServe, to give an understanding of the tools available to help on the AI journey. There will be a demo of one of these runtimes in action by loading open source models from Hugging Face from different domains and querying the models through a web UI. There are great open source tools out there that provide an abstraction layer for application developers where they can consume AI models through APIs independent of understanding the data form of the model. Walking away from this talk, programmers will have a good appreciation of how they can practically consume AI in their applications without being an AI master.",

          "description": "AI models, particularly LLMs, readily and sometimes unwittingly may plagiarize content—what constitutes acceptable use is currently not fully resolved— opening their users to copyright tort and other forms of litigation. For society an immanent danger is also in how easily they can be poisoned or lobotomized to propagate disinformation. It is also difficult to uncover and address sources of bias. The later is of particular legislative concern—see emerging regulations such as the EU’s AI Act as a prototype for whats to come. Without traceability for data with clear license expressions and provenance, AI models are easy targets. The open source community are particularly vulnerable and defenseless. Without a preemptive strategy legal risks are untenable. We expect an avalanche of litigation in response to AI driven disruption of the business of established information providers and creatives. The talk focuses on both the legal and moral issues at hand but also the means to address the issues through traceability and model governance.",

          "description": "Ethical AI has emerged as a pivotal global discourse, reflecting the growing realization of its profound impact on societies worldwide. While social issues give rise to policy solutions and thus legislations, ethics are deeply rooted in societal values that differ greatly from one jurisdiction to another. In the last decade, diverse groups and individuals have departed from using exclusively Free Software licenses on their projects to developing new types of licensing solutions which prioritize “ethical” restrictions on how software should be further used and distributed. In this talk, I will delve into the ethical dimensions of the convergence of AI and Free Software, examining the challenges and opportunities in building responsible and ethical AI solutions within the free software ecosystem. This talk firstly provides examples of some of the most common licensing models imposing “ethical” restrictions. It then examines how licensing models imposing additional behavior restrictions that supposedly call themselves “open” are in contravention of the definitions of Free Software and Open Source Software. We will further explore some predominant material harms emanating from the use of these restrictive licenses. Lastly, given the various technical & legal obstacles in using these restrictive licenses, I implore that the ethical compliance checks must fall within the purview of regulations and not software licenses. Given the proliferation of ethical licenses in AI landscapes causing additional behavior restrictions, integration of Free Software, license compatibility and licensing compliance become more complex, affecting the whole ecosystem. This presentation seeks to increase awareness about this crucial issue, particularly as public funds are being allocated to AI projects that may, at times, employ restrictive licensing practices.",

The Open Source Initiative is inviting developers of AI and users to find the principles of Open Source applied to AI systems. Finding an agreement on what constitutes Open Source AI is the most important challenge facing the free software (also known as open source) movement. European regulation already started referring to \"free and open source AI\", large economic actors like Meta are calling their systems \"open source\" despite the fact that their license contain restrictions on fields-of-use (among other things) and the landscape is evolving so quickly that if we don't keep up, we'll be irrelevant. The session will have a short introduction to the project, which started mid-2023, followed by a summary of the most current draft of the Definition. The bulk of the session will be an assignment for the audience: to review the draft Definition and provide comments. The responses will be used as feedback to release a new draft.",

TechWorks is not specifically an open source organization. However for a number of years it has taken an open approach to many of its standardization practices. For example all the guides from the IoT Security Foundation (part of TechWorks) are release under a Creative Commons license. We will give a brief overview of this organization at the start of the talk. TechWorks identified that the shortage of AI engineers would represent a problem for the industry going forward. However this is an industry with many, experienced software and hardware engineers. The need therefore was for material to help those engineers transition to AI. The result, now 18 months into its development, is an open guide to best practice in AI and Machine Learning for experienced professional engineers (https://technes-uk.github.io/best-practice-guide/). The source is maintained on GitHub and written in Sphinx, using a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://github.com/TechNES-UK/best-practice-guide). This allows easy community contributions using pull-requests. We'll explore the challenges in developing this guide, and share plans for completing the initial release, and then maintaining it going forward.",

          "description": "For developers building distributed applications, few things are more frustrating than having an API break unexpectedly. When an API changes in a backwards-incompatible way, it can disrupt downstream consumers. Suddenly, applications start failing, integrations break, and developers are left scrambling to fix the issues. How can developers deploy changes fast without breaking APIs and maintain stability for consumers? By adding modern observability techniques to their APIOps pipeline. In this talk, we will start together from a traditional APIOps pipeline in ArgoCD and explore how incorporating modern observability techniques can help developers deploy changes quickly and efficiently while maintaining stability for API consumers. In this presentation, Sonja (Group Product Manager in the API space) and Adnan (5 years in the observability space) are combining their expertise to present best practices for detecting and resolving API issues in production. This talk will be helpful for developers working with APIs, helping them extend their GitOps practices by using distributed tracing in pre-production to identify and fix issues before they reach production. But it will also be helpful for any users of OpenTelemetry, Jaeger and/or ArgoCD.",

          "description": "Calendars are a building block of our work tools. Unfortunately, managing calendars is often a nightmare. The reason for this is simple: the big companies hosting most of the calendar services are not trying very hard to provide interroperability between their services, or facilitate the use of calendars not hosted by themselves. One particular setting that is very painful when using calendars is the case of public-calendars. While a lot of organizations have a public-calendar available to stay informed about the events they organize, it is actually very complicated to leverage these calendars in a natural way: First of all, not all caldav clients support public-calendars, or at least not as well as “account” calendars. Often, they allow to “bulk import” multiples ical events inside your calendar client but not suscribe to the underlying calendar. This means that new events will not be added to your calendar automatically; Public-calendars are not easily composable: it is not possible to merge multiple public-calendars together in order for example to share a collection of calendars; It is not possible to filter events in public-calendars. We may be interested only in a subset of events in a calendar (events occuring on mondays for example, or taking place in Paris, or any other criterion). Linkal is a software developped to solve the above problems. It is a public-calendar aggregator server. It acts as a man-in-the-middle between a caldav client and some public-calendars. Given a list of public-calendar, it emulates a calendar collection containing all these calendars. The user can then use its usual caldav client and add the collection as an “account” calendar (specifying the url of the Linkal instance instead of the caldav server). This allows the collection to be shared easily to multiple users and seamlessly updated. The talk will present the challenges to collaborations using calendars and the solutions that Linkal provides.",

With its modern IT architecture and strict data segregation, OpenTalk meets the highest standards of data protection and security, fully compliant with the GDPR.\nIn the public sector, data protection is not just a buzzword; it's a central requirement. OpenTalk provides specialized features and moderation tools specifically developed for such demanding scenarios. This includes features voting, recording, streaming, breakout rooms and a coffee break timer. Don't worry: thanks to its user-friendly design and simple operation, OpenTalk is also accessible to users who are not tech-savvy.\nOpenTalk has been created as a comprehensive European — and therefore GDPR-compliant — alternative for collaboration and communication. It is a video conferencing solution well-suited for agencies, municipalities, administrations as well as personal and business use.\nStarting with the history of the OpenTalk project, this talk will provide insights into features that set it apart from other solutions, its service architecture and the current state of development.

          "description": "Progressively, there are more and more risks associated with computer intelligence, and as a transparent software company we have the responsibility to intervene and protect our users. Recently, Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team, the team that taught employees how to make AI tools responsibly. Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on. The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges. For example, there are problems with: In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has. Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers. Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating. Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers. I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data! I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.",

          "description": "Web Accessibility has a lot of complexities, and most CMS do not have the capacity to invest in it sufficiently. Two years ago Funka organized a Cross-CMS initiative to look at supporting content authors in their efforts to produce accessible content. This EC funded initiative, the We4Authors Cluster brought together Drupal, Joomla, Plone, and Umbreco. This is the only cross-CMS accessibility event I am aware of where maintainers collaborated on common UI elements. It is also the only one I am aware of where user research was done on authors, to help evaluate accessibility. We need more of this. Currently, Environmental Sustainability in the CMS space is given even less of a priority than accessibility. We are in a climate crisis, digital tools are contributing to it, global best practices are emerging, but adoption of these best practices isn't happening fast enough. Collaboration is needed to both raise awareness within our industry, but also find common solutions. Finding common approaches to measure the CO2 impact is an important starting point. Much more will be needed if we are to help the web make significant reductions in energy consumption. These are two places where collaboration is key if we are able to make the advances which are needed for people with disabilities, as well as future generations. Where can we help to optimize our development process, code execution, and the cumulative impact of CO2 produced through the process.",

We are also a technological platform that offers tools in workflow format to make fact-checking processes accessible and feasible for everyone.\nIn an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, establishing robust and reliable fact-checking platforms is crucial. This presentation delves into the unique journey of developing a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) fact-checking platform specifically for the Brazilian community. We explore the intersection of technology, journalism, and civic engagement in the context of Brazil's diverse and dynamic information landscape.\nBrazil, with its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, presents unique challenges in misinformation management. Our project aims not only to address these challenges but also to harness the power of the open-source community in creating a transparent and accountable fact-checking tool. We will discuss the technical hurdles in building a scalable and effective platform, including aspects like real-time data analysis, integration with various media formats, and ensuring user-friendly interfaces that cater to a broad audience.\nAdditionally, we focus on the vital role of community engagement in the development and adoption of the platform. The talk will cover strategies for fostering an active open-source community around the project, encouraging collaboration, and ensuring the platform evolves in response to the community's needs."

To help you gain clarity on your project's goals and core attributes, I'll talk about how to overcome \"assumption-driven development\" to become a better listener to your users. Throughout, I'll also show you how incorporating product management methods can help you to avoid frustration and burnout, whether you're a maintainer or a contributor.\nThis talk will provide an overview of select techniques used by product managers to drive decision-making, focus, and results-oriented experimentation. These techniques will be presented in a manner that takes into consideration the realities and practicalities of trying to achieve development goals in the open source context. For those of you working in open source as part of your day jobs, I'll also discuss how to align your project's delivery objectives with your employer's product roadmap so that you increase the chances of getting the staffing, support, and recognition you want.\nBy the end, you will hopefully take away new knowledge and insights into how to tame your backlog, surface your core objectives and problems to be solved, make your users happier, and keep yourselves—and your fellow contributors—productive with purpose."

          "description": "OSPOs (Open Source Program Offices) are on the rise: from private companies, to public administrations and academia, organisations now often have someone or a team dedicated to open source topics. The idea behind an OSPO is not only to secure open source assets; it's also about being a good citizen, contributing back, and become an active part of the community and ecosystem. The OSPO Alliance published in 2021 the first version of the Good Governance Handbook, a method and framework to help organisations define and build their OSPO. It proposes a list of 25 good practices, from identification of open source assets to HR contracts and community participation, all packed with practical advice and resources from experienced practitioners. We also provide a deployment feature to start your own OSPO in less than 10mn using GitLab. During this session, we will present the latest version of the GGI Handbook (v1.2), how it helps both organisations and the open source community, and start a discussion about how we can help them -- public sector, academia, NGOs, private orgs.. -- become better citizens, adopt good practices and contribute back to our ecosystem.",

Drawing on the speaker's experience building cloud native communities around CNCF, Cilium, and eBPF, this talk is a practical introduction on how to create a place that people want to be. Marketing is a one to many megaphone while community is constructed through a network of one to one relationships. We will break down the steps to develop these relationships from seeding the initial champions to leveraging existing communities to successfully growing beyond the reach of any one single person. The audience will walk away understanding how these one to one relationships and friendships are key to a successful community and how they can create one around their open source project, product, and company too.",

It’s also important for individuals to chart their own path that aligns with their unique experience and interest. In this panel discussion, panelists will share how they got started in their career and their journey over the past two decades. For people looking for jobs in open source, we’ll discuss what we look for in candidates and why it’s not necessary to check all the boxes in job descriptions. We’ll also discuss challenges in balancing your day jobs vs. open source activities during your career. In addition, we’ll also delve into other challenges and opportunities of an open source career that range from dealing with the impostor syndrome, DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) challenges, exploring open source communities for self growth, and more. The goal of this session is to help attendees feel more comfortable exploring opportunities in open source and be confident in charting their own path. Our panel members will share what contributed to their success and the lessons learned throughout their extensive experience in open source. This session is meant to be interactive, and we’ll encourage attendees to ask questions and engage in the conversation.",

          "description": "The growing trend towards confidential computing has presented a significant challenge: making remote attestation, a crucial technology for establishing trust in confidential workloads, easily accessible to application developers. Ideally, leveraging the added transparency and security guarantees of attestation as an authentication mechanism should be simple. However, the current ecosystem often requires engineers to integrate remote attestation at the application layer of the network stack. This task is not only burdensome, diverting attention from core business logic, but also poses privacy risks. Developers are compelled to navigate a complex maze of security protocols, with the ever-present danger of accidentally exposing sensitive information about the devices running these workloads. Developing secure and easy-to-use building blocks requires a collaborative effort between the open-source and standards communities. The IETF is working on various specifications, which are being complemented by prototypes and formal verification of innovative features. Several Internet protocols, such as TLS, OAuth, ACME, Netconf, and CSR/EST, are already incorporating attestation, and others will follow. A key focus of our work is to integrate privacy-preserving techniques that can mitigate the risks inherent in remote attestation, ensuring that this crucial technology can be utilized in a manner that is both user-friendly and privacy-conscious. In this presentation, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current standardization and open-source implementation initiatives. The goal is to make it easier for the broader community to access and engage in this new development, which is crucial for the advancement of the remote attestation infrastructure in general and the utilization of confidential computing in particular.",

This talk will delve into the methods of distributing private container images and OCI artifacts, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of various solutions, especially in contexts like software sales and custom builds for clients. We will begin our discussion with hosted registries, highlighting their cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation, and low maintenance needs. Next, we will explore self-hosted solutions, which offer greater flexibility. Finally, we will examine the integration of an OCI-compatible registry with a custom authorization server. This setup allows the incorporation of complex business logic into authorization decisions, such as custom IAM and product subscriptions. While this adaptable and cost-efficient approach may involve custom development, we will provide a thorough analysis of its implications.",

It came to life as a fork of Canonical's LXD project after Canonical decided to reclaim full ownership of LXD. Incus is a fully fledged system container and virtual machine manager, capable of running either standalone on systems as small as single board computers, or scale up to hundreds of servers to run tens of thousands of instances. It supports advanced storage and networking options and can easily be managed through its command line, a variety of web UIs or its REST API. In this presentation, we'll be going over a bit of the history of LXD and Incus, how it came to be, who's behind it, what state it's currently in and what to look forward to in the near future!",

          "description": "A common question language runtimes have is: how many resources do I have access to? They want to know e.g. how many threads they can run in parallel for their threadpool size, or the number of thread-local memory arenas, etc. The kernel offers many endpoints to query this information. There is /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/stat, sched_getaffinity(), sysinfo(), the cpuset cgroup hierarchy's cpuset.cpus.effective, the isolcpus kernel command line parameter, /sys/devices/system/cpu/online. Further, libcs offer divergent implementations of sysconf(_SC_NPROCESORS_ONLIN). As a bonus, the kernel scheduler may be configured to limit resources using cpu \"shares\" or cpu quotas, so a task may be able to run on all cores, but have some kind of rate limit that is not reflected in the physical cores the system is allowed to run on. In this talk, we propose a new library \"libamicontained\" to offer one place to consolidate the logic for the answer to this question. We propose a: library which is aware of all of these different runtime configurations and answers questions about cpu counts etc. in accordingly reasonable ways. Of course, the real challenge here is adoption. Ideally we can pitch such a library as \"from the container people\", so it's an easier pitch to language runtimes. We are here seeking feedback on all points (heuristics to reason about CPU counts, design goals, etc.) from container people as a first step. [2]: as of this writing, the jvm still uses cpuset.cpus instead of cpuset.cpus.effective on cgroupv2: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/7fbfb3b74a283261027e6c293e1a5dbc354cf0af/src/hotspot/os/linux/cgroupV2Subsystem_linux.cpp#L92-L96 [3]: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/2297 , https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6252",

We have elected to do so by creating a single LXC container for the application, that contains each rootfs image, and running each process in a chroot, using bind mounts for special directories such as /proc, /dev, /sys, and /run. This reduces the overhead of multiple containers, but could have drawbacks with respect to compatibility between processes from different distributions, and security within the application. As of the time of this talk, we will have tested an implementation of this strategy, and we will report our findings regarding its advantages and disadvantages."

On an image-based Linux system this allows atomically updating the rootfs without causing interruptions for workloads that run on discrete and separate filesystem images. This talk will briefly explore this new feature, listing new improvements from the latest version, and showing a demo of a soft-reboot being applied on an Azure Boost machine with two surviving critical portable services running without interruptions while the rest of the OS is restarted.\nWe will explore what container runtimes maintainers would need to do in order to support this feature. systemd-portabled already supports it for Portable Services."

The configuration is well-suited for home server applications as it enables the user to efficiently manage media files and execute sysadmin tasks without requiring root access. In particular, delegating the setup to a playbook that does not require root ensures that the system converges to the desired state without the need for a superuser. This short talk focuses on a common scenario where a rootless setup may require remapping UIDs and GIDs, which can be quite challenging to maintain over time. Due to the nature of these use cases, Ansible is frequently one of the best options for setting up, updating, and keeping a system up and running over time. Finally, this presentation covers other common needs of a container setup, such as the need to store secrets, manage services separated into logical units, and reproduce the setup on different systems."

But as we enter 2024, containerd is continuing with pre-GA releases of a new 2.0 line that includes new features, deprecates a long history of older functionality and hopefully provides a solid basis to take containerd into the future, or at least the next eight years!\nThis talk will walk attendees through new functionality in 2.0, what's changing, and how we continue to make containerd a core, reliable runtime with lots of extensibility. We'll highlight adopters and use cases both old and new, including the new WASM shim, new lazy loading technology, and many others."

          "description": "eBPF stands as a groundbreaking technology enabling the execution of programs in an isolated space within the kernel of the operating system, operating with privileged access. This technology proves valuable for safely and efficiently expanding the kernel's capabilities without necessitating alterations to the source code or the loading of additional modules. This approach provides direct access to the Linux kernel space, leading to notable improvements in performance.\nA key facilitator in this landscape is bpfd, a system daemon explicitly designed to streamline the deployment and management of eBPF applications, falling under the umbrella of Extended Berkeley Packet Filter.\nbpfd boasts an operator specifically crafted for utilization within Kubernetes, allowing users to deploy eBPF programs using a Custom Resource (CR) within a Kubernetes cluster.\nDuring our discussion, we will delve into the developmental journey of bpfd, tracing its origins from Aya, a Rust library designed for eBPF development. Our exploration will extend to practical aspects such as leveraging the operator, deploying applications, and understanding how Fedora elevates the user experience as a host.\nA significant focus will be placed on addressing security concerns pertaining to pods designated for the execution of eBPF applications within Kubernetes. Additionally, we will explore the challenges and outstanding tasks related to integration with Kubernetes, along with insights on collaborative efforts within the eBPF sig-group in Fedora.\nIt's worth noting that eBPF has already been adopted in production environments by prominent companies, including Google, Netflix, Shopify, and Cloudflare. Join us for an insightful discussion on the evolving landscape of eBPF orchestration in Kubernetes and Fedora.\nbpfman repo bpfd/bpfman documentation Fedora eBPF SIG"

Typically such a problem might be solved using a distributed storage layer driven by a byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm. After the first prototype in 2022 (presented at FOSDEM 2023) the project has improved and a new version of the storage layer and also the DNS logic is available for FOSDEM 2024.",

In 2003 he co-founded a small SaaS-model based company in Switzerland, which reached market leadership in the sector a few years later. After 2015 Konrad and his partner decided to leave corporate life behind and to dedicate their time and knowledge to privacy- and freedom-related technology projects.\nSince 2022 Konrad is also lecturer at University of Applied Science and Arts, Lucerne, Switzerland, teaching \"Distributed Systems and Microservices\". He talks and teaches about free/libre software.\nKonrad dedicates most of his time and knowledge to the development of free software (like AGPL or better) software. This work is done within the non-profit and open association \"diva.exchange\". It is today a recognized research institution cooperating with universities by funding and supporting research projects."

          "description": "Subtitle: Continuous Evolution Keeps 1960s Technology Alive Short Abstract: M is a conceptually simple language tightly coupled to a conceptually simple database. Originally developed in the mid to late 1960s, the technology has evolved to stay relevant in the 21st century. The talk reviews the history of the technology, the conceptual simplicity of both the M language and M database, and how the technology survives by evolving to adapt to the changing world of computing. Portability was a goal since its earliest days. Longer Description: M first ran on a PDP-7 and was a complete software stack: an operating system, a database, and a language. To run on such limited hardware, M seamlessly coupled a minimalistic database with a minimalistic language. It was based on a small number of concepts. Fast forward more than a half century. While M is not mainstream software technology, it is the language and database of the largest real-time core-banking and electronic medical record systems. For example, a nation-scale medical record system in Jordan runs a complete FOSS stack developed in M. To robustly and securely serve such large-scale, mission-critical systems that require \"five nines\" availability, M has retained its core principles of a minimalistic language and efficient implementation, which allows it to scale down as well as up: the YottaDB implementation of M delivers thousands of database accesses per second even on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a consumer grade MicroSD card. To remain relevant with changing economics and technology, M had to evolve. It moved from days when the cost of the hardware dominated, programmers were economical, and software was freely bundled with the hardware, to today. It has done so without compromising its foundational values. It ceased to be an operating system as it was ported to other computing platforms. A production grade implementation was released under a copyleft license in 2000/2001. While the M language retains its conceptual simplicity, the tight coupling of M, the language, with M, the database, now extends to other languages, C, Go, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, and Rust. The talk will use examples from lua-yottadb, which tightly binds a highly capable minimalistic language and a highly capable minimalistic database. Links:",

          "description": "The behaviour of repos over time will be examined from the perspective of semantic graphs and qualifying annotations. The focus will not only be concerning direct diffs within a specific commit but emphasizing greater contextualization of what was taking place. For example, understanding the relationship of a commit in the context of a project's sections; functionality; or symbiotic repos. Through the use of logic programming (SWI-Prolog) and the useful of (RDF) principles, demonstrations will include: * How historic changes to files in a VCS should not be treated as logs of affect but additionally as components for adapting other coding and knowledge assets; * How failure to preemptively describe the desired outcomes from a successful commit mean that there is a failure to provide preparatory automation behaviours. The aforementioned logic programming and RDF expositions will demonstrate the evolution of the (historically NLNet funded) project Icebreaker. It shall be mixing its parsing syntaxes from seperate projects (kanban boards and knowledge-management with syntaxes for time series analyses of repos). There will be a showing of how task management; documentation; and coding intersect using perspectives from how annotations from the \"Recursive-Modelling-Language\" Qiuy intersect over time. Anybody who has lost an afternoon because of a 1 character mistake in their coding understands the grim insights from the proverb \"For Want of a Nail\". However, for non coding activities such errors or omittances are more subtle, as the fallout from things tends to be less direct (such as for lost capacity, imprecision or diminished returns). To return to the proverb, the nail is the instigator of a chain of events, rather than a technical or procedural. People are unlikely to posit \"For Want of Annealing\" to highlight the pernicious effects of qualified deficiencies. The consequence of this presentation will be to demonstrate how underutilized qualitative and graph orientated approaches are for modern project management.",

          "description": "Last year, I presented DB48X, an open-source firmware for the DM42 and DM32 calculators from SwissMicros (https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/reversepolishlisp). The goal is to create the best scientific programmable calculator for engineers, based on (and improving upon) the user experience of calculators such as the HP48 series. The DM42 has a serious limitation: there is about 700K of available flash space for the program, and about 70K of available RAM. So the question is: how much math can we fit in 700K. This year, I would like to demonstrate what already works, including support for: * big integers * based numbers * complex numbers * vectors and matrices * symbolic computations * integration and differentiation * engineering units * plots and charts * data processing * RPL programming and debugging The focus of the talk would be on how to use C++ to write really compact and efficient code, notably three interesting points: 1/ C++ and garbage collection? Huh? (The DB48X object model) 2/ Using template meta-programming to generate data tables representing symbolic expressions and RPL programs 3/ Performance tuning vs. code space I will also share some of the funniest or most interesting bugs I ran into (e.g.: It runs on USB power, but halts when on battery)",

          "description": "As free software programmers, whether we like it or not, we often host our projects on large centralized and proprietary software forges such as GitHub. In theory, it is perfectly possible to host our own forges using free software such as GitLab, Gitea, etc. But, life is short, and setup and maintenance of these services is more work than it seems at first. GNU Guix is well-known as a package manager, for the high quality of its packages, and for the strong reproducibility guarantees it provides. But, it is much less appreciated for its services, system definitions and deployment features. That's such a shame since these features can let you summon and dismiss entire systems at will—be they bare-metal or virtualized—with nothing but a declarative plain text configuration file. In this talk, I will speak about guix-forge, a Guix channel that provides Guix services for easy setup and maintenance of a software forge. guix-forge uses existing free software such as cgit and/or klaus for serving git repositories on the web, laminar and webhook for continuous integration, uacme for managing TLS certificates, etc.",

From a being just a wild idea back in 2019, the language has grown into a small community of users (roughly measured by its ~1.8k GitHub stars). With growth, the language's strengths and weaknesses became more evident, and with those come feature requests. How to keep the language small and still address the needs of users, while remaining faithful to the spirit of Lua and not falling into pitfalls from the past? In this talk we'll discuss some pragmatic choices in Teal's design that were made to balance those concerns: to make it more powerful, while keeping it small.",

Having access to concise skill definitions for a CMS project helps teaching it, helps identify required learning goals and shows what a person already knows when starting to learn about CMS. SkillDisplay wants help creating a shared standard, highlighting similarities and synergies between different CMS projects, offering people easier access to FOSS technologies.",

          "description": "Accessibility is a key requirement in modern web applications — not only because of new legislative requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), but because it is also a human right and a cornerstone of an inclusive society. This presentation aims to shed light on the on the different kinds of barriers a user might encounter in a modern web application (especially in the context of the \"usual suspects\" of content management systems like Wordpress or TYPO3), and also show that there are some barriers that all users may encounter, regardless of their physical or mental ability. Instead, some barriers may arise from the technology available to a user (who possibly only has access to a low-end device, works with a spotty network connection or does not have access to a required input device), the education of a user, their language comprehension and many other factors. We will explore key accessibility principles to allow users to overcome these barriers and share real-world practical examples to illustrate the impact of accessible design on user experience and inclusivity. We will provide actionable strategies for developers and UX designers to enhance accessibility working with or on these CMS frameworks. Attendees will gain insights into optimizing software and content for diverse user needs, ensuring compliance with global accessibility standards and regulatory requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), and leveraging the latest technologies to create a more inclusive digital landscape.",

In comparison, Drupal has historically had no centralised product management or marketing, let alone ANY coordinated budget! This talk will look at the challenges Drupal is facing now that it competes head to head with proprietary giants like Adobe in the enterprise sector. From the perspective of his role on the Drupal Association board, Owen will discuss the strategies and initiatives the Drupal community is starting to put in place to remain competitive and how these approaches can be shared by other open source projects."

It is built on the concept of pages as tree-structured database models. In recent years, its content management features have been extracted to not only work on page models, but any arbitrary database model.\nWe will explore how these features work and how they were implemented in Wagtail. We will also discuss how they can fit in other CMSs.\nThis talk does not require any pre-existing knowledge about Django and Wagtail CMS, though familiarity with content management systems and basics of object-relational mapping is expected."

Beyond the minimum effort to provide basic SecureBoot compatibility most distributions haven't (yet) delivered tangible benefits to users. In this talk I'd like to give an overview on how distributions can reasonably jump on the system integrity train, that makes the boot process and OS somewhat proof to offline attacks, and allows them to catch up with similar functionality that other commercial OSes have already been providing for a while. This talk will be from a systemd perspective, and focus on the various OS integrity components we now provide, and how to put them together, with a focus on keeping things nicely generic, democatric, and modular without compromising security. Specifically, we'll touch immutable initrds, UKIs, full disk encryption policies, TPM, and Measured Boot vs. Secure Boot, and more, → systemd Homepage",

As blind software engineers, we believe we can bring a unique perspective to this essential endeavor. We'll explore the challenges faced by blind users when using the Linux desktop environment, with a focus on constructive solutions. We will discuss two main topics: lack of preinstalled assistive technologies and accessibility problems of basic components of desktop environments. Our goal is to offer guidance and encouragement to developers, empowering them to create more inclusive experiences for all users. In our vision for the ideal accessibility scenario, Linux distributions seamlessly accommodate the needs of blind users. To achieve this, we'll stress the importance of collaboration among developers and upstream projects, ensuring that accessibility becomes a fundamental consideration in the development process. Additionally, we'll introduce the \"Linux Accessibility Guide\", a valuable resource that can assist developers in making graphical applications more accessible. This guide will offer practical insights and best practices to support their efforts. Join us as we embark on a journey to improve the accessibility of Linux distributions, fostering an environment where accessibility is a shared goal, benefiting blind users and the entire Linux community. Together, we can create a more accessible and inclusive Linux desktop experience.",

This has left many confused about the state of Enterprise Linux. In open source, transparency, and sharing of ideas is critical. But it's more than just what you share, it's how you share it. This talk will delve into the state of Enterprise Linux from Red Hat's perspective and share it in a community driven way.\nThe upstream and downstream relationships that make up the RHEL supply chain contribute to what is arguably the largest and most sophisticated open source supply chain in the world. This large, sophisticated supply chain, and all of the Independent Software Developers (ISVs) involved, give RHEL a lot of gravity, probably more than any other open source product.\nFor years, I think many of us in the open source world assumed that we knew everything there was to know about open source, but the truth is, we’re all still learning. In the last couple of years, there have been some big changes in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) supply chain, often referred to as Enterprise Linux or EL for short. This talk will try to share a representative opinion from Red Hat about where we see Enterprise Linux today, where we think it's going, and where we'd like to take it."

Instead, we propose to build initrd images out of distribution packages. This results in initrds that behave more like a regular Linux system, making them more reliable.\nIn this talk, we'll present mkosi-initrd, a project to build initrds out of distribution packages using mkosi (https://github.com/systemd/mkosi), systemd's image builder sister project. While it started as a Fedora project , mkosi-initrd has recently gained support for Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, CentOS, RHEL, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux and Arch Linux. We'll discuss the new distribution-independent implementation, what's implemented and what's still missing. We'll also give a brief introduction on mkosi itself.\nWe're hoping to start a discussion on what it would take for popular distributions to consider adopting this approach to building initrds and to leave FOSDEM with new ideas on how to improve the project."

          "description": "In 2023, embedded Linux developers received eagerly awaited news: the release of Raspberry Pi 5 and the integration of VNC backend into Weston, the reference compositor for the Wayland display server protocol. During this talk we will explore VNC backend integration in Weston 12 and newer versions as well as its build and runtime dependencies such as NeatVNC and AML. We will compare VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). Using the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded, we are going to build core-image-weston for Raspberry Pi 5 and configure VNC with TLS security and user authentication. Step-by-step tutorial will be provided to demonstrate the configuration of a remote connection to Raspberry Pi 5 from another computer through Vinagre, an open-source VNC client designed for the GNOME Desktop. The presentation is appropriate for anyone interested in remote access to embedded Linux devices. It will expand upon Leon’s lightning talk about RDP from FOSDEM 2023 and address frequently asked questions about remote screen sharing on embedded Linux devices. Previous experience is not required.",

At the same time linux distributions for industrial embedded computer are often based on Yocto/OpenEmbedded or buildroot. This talks will explore what is required to install and run a non modified Debian in an industrial arm/arm64 embedded device running the U-Boot bootloader. We will investigate the various option to install Debian, either running debian-installer (from network or from an external storage media) or using debootstrap, we will look into how the bootloader is loading the OS (kernel, initrd and devicetree), looking at U-Boot distroboot/Standard Boot and UEFI and after that we will have a look at the required support from the Linux kernel. During the talk we will also describe the steps needed to contribute support for a specific board to Debian.",

          "description": "Support for hardware video codecs has been around in V4L2 since the memory-to-memory (M2M) framework was merged in 2010. While it initially allowed support for firmware-driven stateful implementations, it did not cover the case of stateless hardware codecs where the kernel has to configure hardware blocks directly instead of relying on a (proprietary) firmware. Stateless video decoding became supported in 2018 after Bootlin's successful crowdfunding campaign targeting Allwinner platforms. The only remaining piece missing after this work was support for stateless video encoders. This talk will present the current effort to bring support for stateless video encoders in mainline V4L2. This includes an overview of the current preliminary work on selected hardware platforms and video codecs as well as a brief summary of today's out-of-tree support. It will be followed by an introduction to the difficult process of creating a new userspace API to support them in mainline Linux, the inherent trade-offs that need arbitration and why this is taking time to converge.",

          "description": "Many recent Windows (on ARM and x86) laptops have replaced the standard UVC USB camera module with a raw MIPI camera-sensor using a CSI receiver and ISP in the CPU to process the raw data into an image. Both the hw interface of the ISP as well as the image processing algorithms used are often considered a trade secret by CPU vendors. This makes supporting these cameras under Linux a big challenge and so far these cameras are not supported. Both Linaro and Red Hat have identified this as a problem. Linaro has started a project to add a SoftwareISP component to libcamera to allow these cameras to work without needing proprietary software and Red Hat has joined Linaro in working on this. These exact same problems with MIPI cameras are also seen in embedded and automotive uses and the new SoftISP is also targeting these. This talk will present and demo the current state of the SoftwareISP as well as present future plans. We hope there will be plenty of community feedback, so we will leave ample time for questions and discussions at the end.",

          "description": "The barcode scanner market is a walled garden hostile to flexibility. Vendors enforce their proprietary SDKs or applications, documentation is often limited or missing, sometimes it is even required to sign a contract before getting software access to purchased devices. This locks the user inside a single ecosystem, as switching to a different option would mean rewriting software specific to the device.\nenioka Scan is an open-source Android library enabling users to choose the device vendors that really fit their criteria at any given time. It exposes a single API compatible with all supported scanning devices, working on top of a vendor-specific SDKs made open-source whenever possible. The library handles per-device specifics, so the user can focus on the functional aspects of their application. It is also designed to be easily extended with more support for devices not yet compatible.\nIn this presentation, we will go over the causes of vendor lock-in in the context of barcode scanning devices. After a quick history of the project, we will have an overview of how the library works and how it manages to handle devices from different vendors. We will then take a look at \"quick start\" guide on how to reverse engineer a proprietary SDK to integrate it into the library. Finally, we will explain how you can contribute to this project, and why your help matters."

          "description": "It was a long weekend in May 2020. Like many of my human siblings stuck at home with time on their hands due to an ongoing pandemic, I was busy trying to perfect my bread recipe. Fast forward to a few hours later, I had assembled an Arduino-based “artificial nose” that used a gas sensor and AI (so-called TinyML) to learn and detect scents (hence potentially the smell of a perfectly fermented sourdough starter). As I open-sourced and started to share the project on social media, it went viral… and I felt like an impostor, as most of the code powering it was, frankly, hackish. Or maybe it wasn’t, as it had the merit of having helped me invent something new, in literally a few hours. In this talk I will walk you through some of the key features of the artificial nose, and how I eventually rewrote my original code to leverage Zephyr (an open-source real-time operating system) in order to make it easier for myself and the community to extend the project, and run it on a variety of hardware targets. You will learn, among other things: * How to move from a complex “super loop” to well architected threads and event-based programming ; * How to run TinyML models (ex. TensorFlow Lite) while not compromising the rest of your embedded system ; * How to build an efficient and easy-to-maintain graphical user interface ; * How to leverage Zephyr hardware-abstraction layer. All the code and demonstrations shown in the talk is open source and available on GitHub, and you are very much encouraged to go ahead and build your own artificial nose after the presentation!",

          "description": "Edge computing is becoming increasingly popular for applications that require low latency and high bandwidth. However, building edge computing infrastructure that is both scalable and cost-effective can be challenging. In this talk, we will explore how Project Akri and WebAssembly can be used together to build highly scalable edge computing solutions. We will start by introducing Project Akri, an open-source project that provides a standard way to discover and interact with IoT devices at the edge of the network. We will then discuss how WASM, can be used to run code at the edge of the network, providing a lightweight and portable runtime environment for edge applications. We will also cover some use cases where Project Akri and WASM can be used together, such as building ML models that can run on edge devices or processing sensor data in real-time. Attendees of this talk will gain a better understanding of how the above can be used together to build scalable, cost-effective edge.",

          "description": "Flutter is an open-source UI Software Development kit created by Google using the BSD-3-Clause license. It is used for developing multi-platform applications with a single codebase. While traditionally, Flutter has been used for Android and iOS development, it has been steadily gaining market share in the embedded Linux world. While the meta-flutter layer for Yocto has been usable since version 1.17.0 on March 31st, 2020, the Buildroot embedded Linux SDK has only recently added support, starting with Flutter version 3.13.9 on Buildroot version 2023.11. This talk will cover three main points. The first is a brief history of the numerous difficulties that had to be overcome when adding the Flutter packages and infrastructure to Buildroot. This topic covers several idiosyncrasies of obtaining the source code and cross-compiling Flutter, such as how the source code is downloaded, how it is not currently possible to create an automated reproducible tarball when downloading the source code, and generating a tarball because of a reliance on .git files, how every third-party dependency is bundled into the source tarball, and even a patched clang is included in the source tarball that must be used when compiling. The second point covers the advantages and disadvantages of Flutter compared to Qt QML and LVGL. The final point covers how to start and integrate an existing Flutter project into an existing Buildroot infrastructure using the flutter-gallery package as a reference. This includes using an external tree for development purposes, how to profile an application for performance, and problems/concerns to be aware of. If you use or are interested in using Buildroot for your embedded Linux project and are interested in using Flutter for your next project, then this talk is for you!",

          "description": "One of the tasks at the device forensics team of the Netherlands Forensic Institute is the reverse engineering of soft- and hardware devices for the judicial system. This task spans a lot of different abstractions in the IT ecosystem, from network protocols, to filesystems, encryption algorithms etc. One very active topic of research is the reverse engineering of low level firmware. This topic proves to be quite a bit more difficult than a lot of others on the list.\nOne of the big challenges in the reverse engineering of low-level firmware is the lack of hardware abstractions and known interfaces (e.g. syscall interfaces and libraries with known exported functions). Furthermore, this type of firmware is oftentimes found in on-die ROM, which provides a good incentive to keep it's size small, as this type of memory can be expensive. This usually means there is not a lot of space for (debug) strings either.\nThese factors making static reverse engineering quite a tough challenge, which in turn makes dynamic reversing more attractive. However, this is not an easy task. The lack of hardware abstractions and the presence of memory-mapped peripherals makes emulation no small feat. Outside of some OSINT and cross-referencing, the best one can do is guess at the working of some of these unknown peripherals. But is there a smarter way of guessing?\nIn this talk, we present CONFEDSS, a project for Concolic Firmware Emulation using Dynamic State Selection. This project aims to make it easier for reverse engineers to dynamically reverse low-level firmware by emulating it and using dynamic state selection as an approach to peripheral simulation. We will give a detailed insight into the problems usually encountered with low-level emulation and show it's workings with a live demo, which will hopefully inspire you to use it the next time you want to emulate some BIOS logic for exotic hardware or find where that weird driver quirk comes from."

          "title": "Enhancing OCPP with E2E-Security and Binary Data Streams for a more Secure Energy Ecosystem",
          "description": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of electric vehicle charging, the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) has emerged as a crucial industry standard for communication between charging stations and a central management system. In my presentation I will introduce groundbreaking extensions to OCPP, focusing on the integration of end-to-end digital signatures and binary data streams, a leap forward in efficiency and security within the EV charging ecosystem. The integration of binary data streams via HTTP Web Sockets into OCPP marks a significant enhancement in data transmission efficiency. This approach not only reduces latency and bandwidth usage for large data transfers, but also paves the way for more secure, in-band data transmissions like firmware updates or log file transport. Traditionally, such data transfers required separate HTTP or FTP servers, introducing unnecessary complexity and potential network security risks. With these extensions firmware updates become seamless and more secure, directly within the OCPP framework. Furthermore, the addition of digital signatures to OCPP commands and data structures, such as charging tariffs or grid related commands for controllable consumers according to the German §14a EnWG, introduce a new layer of security and integrity. These signatures ensure that data is not tampered with during transmission - even beyond the traditional scope of OCPP - providing a verifiable trust mechanism in end-to-end EV charging communications and might in the future lead to more cost-efficient intelligent measuring systems. A notable advancement is the use of digital signatures for creating distinct user roles within OCPP. Until now, OCPP lacked the capability to differentiate between user access levels, such as \"normal\" users and \"admin\" users. The introduction of role-based access control, underpinned by digital signatures, allows for precise management of user permissions, enhancing both security and operational efficiency especially in more complex managed charging locations. In my talk, I will delve into the technical implementation details of these extensions. Attendees will gain insights into the practical applications and benefits of these enhancements in the context of the Open Source energy ecosystem. The presentation will also explore the potential future implications and developments that these extensions could usher in, setting the stage for a more secure, efficient, and scalable EV charging infrastructure.",

          "description": "The open source OCPP 2.0.1 CSMS project CitrineOS was initiated by S44. By leveraging over a decade of experience in EV charging software, at S44 we are actively working towards making EV charging more attainable and equitable. In our quest for a greener future, we face a pivotal challenge: by 2030 50% of new U.S. cars will be EVs, but today 28% of chargers in leading cities don't work. Developers must build innovative software to improve and grow the charging network so EV owners can travel with confidence. By creating an open source charge station management system, CitrineOS's goal is to provide the fuel for this change. The project is NEVI compliant, globally available and open to all. CitrineOS is meant to offer a community driven, reliable CSMS that builds a foundation for market participants to innovate on top of a protocol implementation instead of re-inventing the same wheel. The project drives forward the adoption of the OCPP 2.0.1 protocol resulting in more reliable charging networks worldwide. Our hope is that anyone looking to bootstrap a modern charging network, or upgrade an existing one from OCPP 1.6 to OCPP 2.0.1, will consider CitrineOS as their starting point, and that increased community involvement will continue to improve the charging experience delivered by this open source project.

          "description": "The electricity grid faces challenges such as rising electricity demand and the integration of solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, etc. Moreover, smart technologies are being added, providing a wealth of data. The industries associated with these challenges must perform complex calculations to assess the present and future state of the grid. The vast scale and diverse applications demand faster calculations that are cross-platform compatible. Power Grid Model is an open-source library with a C++ core and a well-defined Python API. It conducts state estimation, power flow, and short-circuit calculations for symmetric/asymmetric grids. The library is actively employed in 10+ applications within Alliander. Other major grid operators in the Netherlands, as well as researchers and stakeholders throughout the grid technology chain, use the library to conduct academic, technical, and feasibility studies. In this presentation, we will explore the power-grid-model library, its capabilities, active and future use cases.

The goal of carbon neutrality implies that most of the challenges for TSOs are still to come. All those changes imply drastic changes in the way to perform grid analysis and have appropriate computation modules to perform efficient security assessment. Legacy tools are evolving slowly with low information about used approximations. RTE, the French TSO, believes that Open Source is the perfect answer to build power system tools in an efficient, flexible, transparent, and collaborative way.

          "description": "Managing electrical substations poses significant challenges. The high costs associated with hardware and equipment, as well as the high level of knowledge necessary in electrical engineering, make the work and research in this field accessible only to a select few major electrical companies. The LFEnergy SEAPATH project introduces a paradigm shift in this sector. By aggregating third-party FOSS components, it brings virtualization to electrical grid substations and provides a robust solution for critical infrastructures, enhancing their adaptability and increasing their interconnections. The primary objective of SEAPATH is to transition from a hardware-centric to a software-centric model within substations, leading to reduced costs, improved adaptability, and simplified maintenance and updates. Moreover, the project aims to democratize participation in the field. SEAPATH eliminates the need for specialized equipment in both the construction and testing phases of a substation system. The project further emphasizes an open-source philosophy, incorporating meaningful documentation and a transparent strategy. This presentation will delve into Savoir-faire Linux's experience in replicating a SEAPATH infrastructure in their laboratory. It will provide insights into the architecture of SEAPATH and the essential tools employed for conducting functionnal tests. The tools showcased encompass Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at software level, IEC 61850 Sample Value simulation as well as latency measurements . Crucially, this talk aims to communicate the inclusivity of SEAPATH, making it accessible to a broader audience. By eliminating the need for specialized expertise in electrical engineering, SEAPATH opens the door for researchers, mathematicians, and professionals from diverse backgrounds to contribute meaningfully to the project. The presentation will highlight the collaborative potential of SEAPATH, fostering a community where individuals with various skill sets can actively participate in shaping the future of electrical substation virtualization.",

For grid operators, the rise in renewable energy and electrification of energy consumption leads to the capacity of the grid to near its physical constraints. Forecasting the load on the grid in the next hours to days is essential for anticipating on local congestion and making the most of existing assets. OpenSTEF provides a complete software stack which forecasts the load on the electricity grid for the next hours to days. Given a timeseries of measured (net) load or generation, a fully automated machine learning pipeline is executed which delivers a probabilistic forecast of future load. During this presentation, the implementation of OpenSTEF to fully automatically forecast the load on the grid at the Dutch Distributed System Operator will be shown. Furthermore, the community built around OpenSTEF will be discussed. Take a look at the OpenSTEF website and Github."

          "description": "The energy transition implies making decisions under deep uncertainties. Modelling is known to be effective in providing the evidence needed to shape the transformation of the energy sector in the most cost-effective way. Open source is a known approach to increase accessibility of the energy modelling tools. That led to a rapid increase in a number of available energy models whose development is mainly driven by the academic community. However, developments have focused on a few world regions, where awareness of climate change is high. There is still a coverage gap, especially for countries where the energy sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuels.\nPyPSA meets Earth initiative aims to address this gap by building a global community focused on developing an ecosystem of Pythonic tools, including the modelling framework PyPSA-Earth. The framework may be utilised to build a ready-to-use regional power system model by extracting all the required data in a workflow orchestrated by Snakemake. A community approach enables the participation of regional experts in the development and brings modelling closer to real-life applications.\nOne of the issues found along this route was the lack of ready-to-use tools to integrate the effects of climate change into power system models. A climate development track in PyPSA-Earth addresses this task and aims to implement approaches to account for changes of climate inputs in a physically correct, yet computationally feasible way. To deal with the regional features of national power systems in a systematic way, a country-wise functionality testing has been carried out. As a result, PyPSA-Earth has been adjusted to be fully capable of building a power system model for any country in the world by a single line of code.\nThe presentation will give an overview of the challenges encountered along this way and guide trough the use cases of PyPSA-Earth to tackle the challenges of the energy transition around the globe."

          "description": "In this presentation we introduce the Green Timeline Project, an innovative open-source software for evaluating resource usage in ICT systems over time. Addressing the significant energy consumption of modern software, our tool offers continuous measurement capabilities, akin to a CI/CD pipeline. We highlight the increasing resource usage in software development over time, with an emphasis on understanding the environmental impact of new features. Our tool not only tracks usage but also provides in-depth analysis and a badge system for monitoring. We'll demonstrate tool integration into development workflows and discuss its role in the broader context of software lifecycle assessment, underscoring the importance of sustainability in tech. Contemporary Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems are significant energy consumers, with studies indicating they account for 2-5% of global CO2 emissions. At Green Coding Berlin, our focus is on the development of free (as in beer) open-source, freely accessible software that evaluates the resource utilization of both software and hardware. Our flagship, the Green Metrics Tool, is a cutting-edge, industry-standard tool that prioritizes the assessment of resource usage. Traditional methods of measuring software provide only a momentary glimpse and fail to capture the evolving nature of software development. Our presentation will unveil our continuous software measurement tools, designed to track and analyze resource usage over time.\nWe've observed a consistent increase in resource usage across various software products. For instance, a comparison of an email client from two decades ago with its modern counterparts shows a disproportionate increase in resource impact, despite similar functionalities. Our solution, resembling a CI/CD pipeline, continuously tracks the resource impact of open-source software, including Django, Django-Bakery, curl, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL, allowing for temporal comparisons. This method enables the identification of significant changes in resource consumption.\nThe core aim of our project is to enhance awareness and prove that new software features inevitably escalate environmental impact, a factor that should be integrated into development planning. We offer a comprehensive analysis framework and a versatile badge and monitoring system applicable to all software types. This system allows both users and developers to delve into detailed measurements and understand the impact of various features.\nIn our session, we will illustrate the straightforward process of setting up and integrating these tools into everyday development workflows, empowering participants to gauge the environmental footprint of their software.\nOur discussion will culminate in an exploration of how these practices fit into the larger scope of software lifecycle assessment, emphasizing the importance of sustainability in software development."

          "description": "Functioning power management is important for the entire spectrum of systems, from embedded to server systems. However, the presentation is specifically aimed at analyzing the Linux software stack - inclusive kernel - of embedded products. It shows how embedded Arm64 systems differ from Intel/AMD systems and what impact this has on the power management software design. The presentation gives concrete insights on how to identify wakeups, the impact of scaling governors and many other subsystems of the kernel. The talk is intermixed by numerous practical examples, which should enable the listener to autonomously analyze and optimize the power consumption for complex embedded systems.\nThe talk has no prerequisites for the audience. Topics such as scheduling or CPU frequency governors are introduced in the talk. Of course, the listener should have a basic understanding of a Linux system and at least a basic understanding of concepts such as processes and interrupts.\nEven if the talk focuses on an embedded system, the knowledge provided can, with a few exceptions, also be transferred to a server system. So there is no reason for amd64 people to be left out!\nIn addition, a new power management kernel analyzer tool will be introduced and its use, which is not yet available in the kernel upstream tree. Further, discussions about a more flexible, eBPF based CPUIdle governor and other research topics are introduced and can be discussed."

          "description": "In this talk, I will demonstrate how emulation tools can improve your efficiency and help you meet quality standards. Emulation tools simulate user actions on a computer and can be used for a variety of tasks, including testing software and automating repetitive tasks.\nUsing emulation tools such as xdotool, actiona, and KDE Eco Tester, I will demonstrate how to automate the creation of usage scenarios, as well as share my experience working on preparing KDE applications Kate and Gcompris for Blue Angel Eco Certification. You will learn how these tools can help you save time and effort, and ensure that your software meets eco-friendliness and quality standards.\nWhile emulation tools can be incredibly helpful, they also have their drawbacks. They may not always accurately simulate real-world scenarios and can be complex to set up and use. However, with the right approach, they can be a valuable asset for developers, testers, and anyone interested in sustainable and energy-efficient software. I will provide solutions to these challenges based on my experience working with these tools."

          "description": "Why is digitalization becoming one of the main assets for wind power energy? Wind farms today boast higher capacity factors, indicating that they are producing more energy relative to their installed capacity. Improved design, coupled with advancements in predictive analytics and control systems, have optimized the performance of wind turbines, making them more reliable and productive. The interest in renewable energy and, particularly, in wind power accelerated dramatically as the war in Ukraine took place. For the first time in history the investment in renewables was the primary response to an energy crisis. The increase in wind power capacity involves some new challenges. Older wind turbines are more prone to failure due to aging and at the same time this must be predicted as accurately as possible for the newer ones, based on data collected in real-time in the field. Predictive maintenance can save a lot of time and money by having the right number of spare parts in stock in the right location. Applying DevOps principles to Big Data predictive analytics can help optimize the use of resources and workflows. This produces major improvements to the spare part recommendation based on IoT data. This presentation illustrates how DevOps practices and related Open-Source tools help build an efficient software infrastructure where wind turbines lifetime predictions and spare part stock recommendations are delivered regularly to service engineers."

          "description": "The energy transition is causing major issues on our local network infrastructure as well as individual households to become self sufficient. A know problem for everybody attending. However a practical combined approach is new...\nIn this talk we will be presenting several operational use cases, addressing the combined energy optimisation at household level and maximum self consumption within a district or microgrid (to prevent local congestion). Moreover, we are addressing ways how two worlds, can meet in the middle: the one at grid level with DSO's, system integrators and large (industrial, commercial) users) with the one at the home level (consumers, energy providers, consumer products). In addition we like to share and discuss how the merging of two traditionally separate domains (heating and electricity) will impact optimisation.\nWe will present and show (live demos) the following operational use cases, fully build on open source: - Nottingham City Council - Microgrid optimisation at Eastcroft depot, with V2G, solar, storage, and agile tariffs - Amsterdam Sporenburg - Preventing network congestion involving 500 households, as well as controlling (public) charging infrastructure; preparing for energy sharing - Athens - Energy cooperation with shared solar plant, optimising self consumption with the community members smart homes"

As modifying the bootloader is out of the question, we can at least replace the environment it gives us with a more sensible one. In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to what an EFI bootloader actually is, how they work, and how U-Boot fits into the picture as a second-stage bootloader. I'll cover the work I've been doing to improve Qualcomm support in upstream U-Boot, and how we can drastically lower the barrier of entry for distro support on Qualcomm phones. Lastly, I'll go over the new process for porting a Qualcomm SoC to U-Boot, and demo booting Linux with EFI runtime support on a Qualcomm phone.",

          "description": "Yes, and we’re in pretty good shape! For the last 10 years, Qualcomm’s engineers and Linaro’s Qualcomm Landing Team has been working hard to carefully implement Linux mainline support for Qualcomm platforms, and so far so good it’s pretty good now as you can judge with the very good Thinkpad X13S support. Neil will do a tour of all supported platforms, describe the work the Linaro’s Qualcomm Landing Team has achieved so far and the key features engineers are working on. The Qualcomm SoCs are notoriously very complex and very powerful, and implementing clean, correct, maintainable and extensible support for mainline Linux is particularly hard. Key domains like Power or DSP management were particularly hard to support, with those in good shape multimedia, connectivity and network features getting enabled permitting Qualcomm based devices to offer excellent support while running vanilla (unmodified) Linux kernel ! The Thinkpad X13S is a great example of such support, because until recently it was limited to expensive and hard to buy Qualcomm Reference platforms. Nevertheless the Qualcomm Reference platforms also get as early as possible mainline support, without any concessions on code quality, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mailing-list patches delivered on marketing announcement day. The talk will propose a tour of supported platforms, current and possible future achievements, and integration examples with mobile distributions like PostmarketOS.",

Advanced 5G features, like 5G network slicing support, are not yet supported in ModemManager. These are in the roadmap for future releases, and open for discussion with the community on how to best implement them.

          "description": "Since the introduction of Genode for the PinePhone at this developer room one year ago, this alternative mobile OS has matured to the point of real-world usability for a group of pilot users. In this talk, Genode developer Norman Feske is going to share the experiences made along the way, reiterate the many advances, demonstrate the current version, and ask: What should come next? Genode on the PinePhone realizes a new vision of a smartphone OS designed from the ground up for user autonomy. Following the announcement of the very first version at the FOSS-on-Mobile developer room in 2023, the system got into the hands of a group of pilot users. The talk will share this experience and highlight the key points we met towards our goal of real-world usability. First, we found it important to attain a tight feedback loop between testers and us developers, which prompted us to create a system-update mechanism that allows for instantly updating the system, or rolling it back to any previous version. Now, a new version can reach the hands of testers in a matter of seconds. With the quick way of testing new versions in place, the feedback we got regarding our attempts at implementing energy-saving measures - in particular screen blanking - was quite instructive to attain a refined solution. At a technical level, the solution is interesting as it combines a Forth-based custom power-management firmware with Genode's microkernel-based architecture. Don't worry, the talk will only briefly touch those eccentricities. With the power drain reduced to a practical level, we turned our attention to the application level. The talk will briefly introduce our SDK named Goa, which streamlines the development to the point where almost unmodified Qt/QML-based applications can be targeted at the Genode-based phone. To stress the latter point, we made the Linphone VoIP stack available on this system. The talk will be garnished by practical demonstrations. Besides being thrilled to present the current state, I'm eager to gather feedback from the community about the most worthwhile directions for the next year.",

          "description": "Many of us were drawn to Linux by the amazing possibilities and combinations we could create while running the operating system. Such things were often not possible back then with operating systems like Windows. Now, history is repeating itself with Android and iOS. Most of the devices we buy are highly locked and restricted, limiting our ability to do what we want on these devices. Even after spending many hours recompiling the entire system or patching it, there's no guarantee of achieving satisfactory results. Linux allows us to do incredible things, encouraging experimentation, play, and learning. As a Mesa3D developer, I have chosen to share my journey of running an LLM model using OpenCL as an example.",

          "description": "This talk delves into the evolution of Ubuntu Touch on PINE64 devices since its release in 2020. Over the past several years there have been significant changes, both to the development team and the codebase. The shifts in the UBPorts/PINE64 community stem from the original PinePhone port’s maintainer moving on from the project, which coincided with the release of the PinePhone Pro. This left the community at a crossroads: necessitating the search for a new maintainer and the development of a new port. A key milestone in this journey was the showcasing of an early-stage community port for the PinePhone Pro running on Ubuntu Touch 20.04 at FOSDEM last year. Since then, a new maintainer has achieved remarkable improvements, including porting 20.04 to the original PinePhone and PineTab, as well as the newly released PineTab2. This presentation will explore the challenges encountered in integrating new devices, updating existing ones, and the process of harmonizing mainline Linux with Ubuntu Touch. This is particularly crucial as Ubuntu Touch has historically leaned towards devices designed for Android/Halium-based devices, somewhat sidelining mainline Linux in the transition to 20.04. Furthermore, the discussion will extend to the future prospects of this port and its implications for Lomiri on mainline Linux across different distributions.",

          "description": "The Gecko rendering engine is used in many weird and wonderful places. For over a decade it has been the stock rendering engine for the default browser on Sailfish OS, a Linux-based mobile operating system for use on mobile phones and tablets. The browser implementation was originally developed around the EmbedLite/xulrunner API, which is no longer officially supported. This provides interesting challenges for keeping the browser up-to-date with the latest Gecko changes. For the last 92 days (maybe more depending on when you're reading this) I've been daily-blogging about my experiences upgrading the ESR 78 Gecko rendering engine used on Sailfish OS to ESR 91. Once ESR 91 is complete the plan is to move to ESR 102 and beyond. Eventually we hope to reach a stable rhythm alongside the official Gecko releases. This has been a communal effort, with other members of the Sailfish OS community helping with the development, from submitting changes to tooling to creating AI-generated images to liven up the blog posts. Many users from the community are now involved all with the singular aim of getting our Gecko upgraded. The breadth of technologies involved (Rust, C++, JavaScript, Python) makes it a fascinating project to work with and write about. We've learnt a lot about the Gecko codebase in the process as well as the challenges in deploying Gecko to unusual mobile and embedded platforms. Our hope is that once we reach the latest version, we'll be able to look into contributing more changes upstream to help maintain our Gecko deployment more easily in the future. We'd love to discuss the best way to achieve this. In this talk I'll share my experiences of working with Gecko in an open way and in collaboration with the community, before opening it out to a discussion about how best to work with upstream.

I worked at the Advanced Processor Technologies (APT) group of the University of Manchester where I led the development of the Maxine VM, a metacircular Java-in-Java VM. Before that I worked at the Computer Architecture and VLSI Systems Laboratory (CARV) of FORTH-ICS, where in the context of the GreenVM project, I developed DiSquawk, a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that targets non-cache-coherent architectures. During my post-graduate studies I also developed SCOOP, a source-to-source compiler that used information from task annotations (memory footprints) to generate optimized code for task-based runtime systems. I was also involved in the development and performance analysis process of the TPC (Tagged Procedure Calls), BDDT (Block-level Dynamic Dependence Analysis for Deterministic Task-Based Parallelism) and PARTEE (PARallel Task Execution Engine) task-based runtime systems."

JFR has been re-implemented in Native Image so that it can be included with executables and behave with a similar experience to JFR in OpenJDK. In this presentation, we'll peel back the layers and give you a tour of some of the most vital parts of JFR's inner workings in Native Image. At various points, we'll stop and draw comparisons to how JFR is implemented in OpenJDK.\nFrom this presentation, listeners will get exposure to some of the unique challenges to developing low-level implementations for Java-on-Java and ahead-of-time compiled applications. They will also gain a better understanding of how key JFR components work under-the-hood."

          "description": "The Java platform has always provided a rich set of libraries to allow developers to reach beyond the boundaries of the JVM, from databases (JDBC) to web services (HTTP client). Unfortunately, accessing foreign memory (i.e. memory not managed by the JVM) and invoking foreign functions (i.e. code outside the JVM) in Java is still significantly harder than it should be.\nThe Foreign Function & Memory Access API (FFM API in short) is a new API in Java SE 22 which aims at reducing the impedance mismatch between Java applications and native libraries in three steps.\nFirst, the FFM API provides a rich API to model a region of off-heap memory as a memory segment. The contents of memory segments can be described using memory layouts, and accessed using var handles. Moreover, the lifetime of memory segments is managed explicitly, and safely, thus reducing the risk of use-after-free bugs.\nSecond, the FFM API provides a rich API to describe and link native functions. Once linked, such functions can then be invoked, using method handles. The dual - turning Java methods into function pointers - is also possible, thus achieving full bi-directional interoperability between Java and native code.\nThird, thanks to the compositional nature of the FFM API, access to native libraries can be simplified even further with the use of a tool (jextract) which mechanically generates the FFM API artifacts needed to access said libraries.\nDesigning a complex API such as the FFM API poses some unique design and implementation challenges: how does a Java program reason about the lifetime of a region of memory outside the boundaries of the Java heap? How can it describe the signature of foreign functions? And, what new risks does the FFM API pose to the integrity of the Java platform as a whole? Resolving such challenges requires a careful balancing act, where access to low-level features is realized in ways that are consistent with the evolution and the core principles of the Java platform."

          "description": "The Fuzion language is a hybrid functional and object-oriented language that in many respects behaves exactly diametrical to Java. Nevertheless, the JVM has turned out an excellent target platform for Fuzion and in this talk I will present why that is the case and what challenges had to be overcome.\nFuzion uses algebraic types, i.e., product types and tagged union types. All types can be parametric, but unlike Java not using type-erasure but monomorphisation.\nUnlike Java, where user defined types have reference semantics, Fuzion has value semantics by default, reference semantics only for types that are explicitly declared so.\nI will present how these are implemented in the new JVM byte-code back-end and what trade-offs and optimizations are made. In particular, I will\npresent several levels of optimizations for tagged union types when mapped to efficient to byte-code\nshow how product type with value semantics are implemented, where the JIT compiler creates surprisingly efficient code and how we all could profit form project valhalla\nexplain how type parameters (generics) are implemented using monomorphisation including support for basic types as type parameters and what benefits this brings.\nanalyze the JVM's black magic of method dispatch and its impact on implementing dynamic dispatch for multiple inheritance in Fuzion.\nshow how the classfile verifier helped to fix bugs in the C backend\nLinks: - github: https://github.com/tokiwa-software/fuzion - Fuzion portal: https://flang.dev"

          "description": "The JVM vs. WebAssembly: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis This session contrasts, in extreme detail, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and WebAssembly (Wasm), two platforms that have reshaped the landscape of software development. While their basic architecture of a \"virtual machine\" draws parallels, their design, intentions, bytecode formats, and future directions reveal considerable differences. Differences in Intent and Bytecode Adaptations We'll examine the underlying intentions behind the creation of the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM was initially designed to support the Java language, it has since accommodated other languages like Scala, Groovy, and Kotlin, and has been provided with implementations for dynamic languages like Ruby and Python. WebAssembly, on the other hand, was designed from the outset to support multiple languages, aiming to serve as a compact binary format for the web. We'll analyze how these intentions have influenced the way other languages have been adapted to their respective bytecode formats, by carefully examining the pain points found in JVM and Wasm implementations across the same source languages Bytecode Differences, Implementation, and Control Flow Here we will delve into the technical details of each platform's bytecode. While the JVM uses stack-based bytecode, WebAssembly uses a structured stack machine model. The implications of these different approaches will be discussed, with particular attention to aspects like performance, security, and portability. We'll also explore their respective implementations and control flow mechanisms through the use of detailed code examples, as well as high-level expositions. Standardization Processes, Stakeholders, and Incentives An important part of this talk will focus on the standardization processes of both the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM’s specification is controlled by Oracle, with community input through the Java Community Process (JCP), WebAssembly is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). We'll discuss the various stakeholders involved in each process and explore the incentives that drive the evolution of these systems. The Future of WebAssembly We'll discuss the future direction of WebAssembly, touching on upcoming proposals such as garbage collection, and the Component Model. Additionally, we'll look at the development of runtimes like Wasmtime, the WebAssembly Micro-Runtime (WAMR), and GraalWasm, and discuss how these work to extend the reach of WebAssembly in new and interesting ways JVM and the Universal Compilation Target In our closing discussion, we'll tackle the common assertion that WebAssembly is \"just the JVM again\", and explore why the JVM didn’t quite become the universal compilation target it was often touted years ago. Factors such as the JVM's resource usage, security issues, specific design details have all played a part, and we'll discuss how and what WebAssembly has learned from these challenges. This session's ultimate goal is to give attendees a detailed understanding of the JVM and WebAssembly, enabling more informed decisions in software development and a clearer perspective on the futures of these two technologies.",

          "description": "This summer, I worked with my mentor Jan Hubicka and Martin Jambor on a project to bypass assembler when generating LTO object files. Here is a brief insight into my project: Link Time Optimization (LTO) enables GCC to dump its internal representation (GIMPLE) to disk so that a single executable can be optimized as a single module. The current implementation creates an assembly file, and the assembler creates the final LTO object file from the provided binary contents. This project aims to create Link-time-optimization (LTO) object files directly from the compiler to improve compile time performance significantly by bypassing the assembler. The GCC's LTO infrastructure has matured enough to compile large real-world applications. Thus, this project will significantly reduce their compile time once completed. - More detail: https://github.com/rsh-raj/gcc-gsoc-submission/tree/main\nIn this presentation, I will discuss the current state of my project and future direction. Additionally, I will delve into my journey, discussing the challenges I encountered as a beginner working with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and how I overcame them with the community's help."

Yet Compiler-Explorer can do much more than simply displaying the assembly: sharing a compilation, using libraries, executing the program, using various tools (on source code or on resulting binaries), visualizing the CFG, accessing its services through an API, etc.\nFor a compiler user, the website is useful to test how a given language construct is compiled, to optimize for size and/or performance, etc. For a compiler developer, the website can be used to share bug reproducer, test if a bug applies to other versions of the compiler, inspect IR dumps, use scripts to automate some tasks, etc.\nI'm proposing a short presentation focused on how Compiler-Explorer can be used around GCC: compare the results of different compilations, inspect the Tree/RTL dumps, check the result for other compiler versions/arguments, etc. I'm also interested in getting some feedback and/or ideas for new features."

          "description": "GCC Static Analyzer (SA) is a highly promising tool aiming to enhance the compiler with extensive analysis capabilities, such as through the use of a plugin API. We used it to implement an analysis targeting constant-time vulnerabilities. Most of the existing tools rely on formal methods and remain barely used (see Jancar et al.). This study conclude that compiler-based tools are well-received among cryptographic developers.\nOur initial tests highlighted that the primary design of the analyzer's inner state machines heavily relies on pointer-related analysis, which leverages alias analysis. However, it was triggering undesirable side effects in our case. The needs for our analysis is to also be able to track state for lvalue, alongside rvalue, depending of the target's type.\nThe subject of this talk is to introduce a practical case where this behavior would allow such analysis to be done, especially since the SA codebase is already heavily prepared for it. A proof-of-concept to give this ability to the SA has been implemented and aims to be merged after feedback from the community on the idea. Problems caused by some aspects of C semantics arise and will be interesting to discuss (e.g., the thin frontier between arrays and pointers).\nSource code of the project is publicly available here: https://gitlab.inria.fr/pphilipp/gcc-plugin-ct.\nPrior knowledge for attending: GCC internals and GCC SA basic knowledge, C semantics."

          "description": "Many GNU Linux distributions start their own bootstrap process with a set of binary seeds. Because, how do you build a modern C/C++ compiler without a C/C++ compiler? To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, an approach taken by some distributions is to rely on opaque, pre-build binaries. However, in order to increase trustworthiness in software, we should be able to produce every part of it from source, or at least reduce the size of the initial binary seed to the absolute minimum.\nIn the bootstrappable builds movement, the GCC version 4.7 plays an important role: it is the last GCC version that can be built with only a C compiler. Therefore, this compiler is a stepping stone for bootstrapping everything that relies on the C++ language and above. Another important metric for trustworthiness is the capability to build reproducibly, independently of the build directory, which we addressed with patches, as it is not a native feature of this compiler version. Furthermore, additional patches were required for bringing this compiler version up to date, i.e., adding support for more recent C libraries (e.g., the musl libc) and for obtaining a compiler installation that works independently of its install prefix.\nWe would like to present a build description (for the JustBuild build system), used to patch and bootstrap a GCC version 4.7 on a minimal x86_64 Linux system, which only needs a POSIX shell, coreutils, and a C library (GNU, musl) installed. To achieve this, the bootstrap process starts by building Busybox, GNU Make, and Binutils from scratch before those are used to bootstrap GCC 4.7. We can furthermore show how that compiler can then be used to bootstrap additional build tools (Make, CMake, Python) and even the most recent compilers (GCC 13.2, Clang 17), all from source on the exact same minimal system. In doing so, we basically bootstrap an extremely minimalistic Linux distribution for building compiler toolchains. All of that is strictly defined within a single JustBuild project, which is publicly available under an open-source license at: https://github.com/just-buildsystem/bootstrappable-toolchain."
